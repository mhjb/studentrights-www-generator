<h1>2. Management and discipline</h1><h2 id="">Boards of trustees: Their role and powers</h2><h4 id="">What powers and responsibilities does the board of trustees have?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 72, 75(2), 76</p><p class="Body"><span>W</span>hereas the principal deals with the day-to-day management of the school, the school&#x2019;s board provides overall direction for areas such as finance, property, staffing and discipline. The Education Act gives the board very wide powers and rights: it says the board has &#x201C;complete discretion to control the management of the school as it thinks fit&#x201D;. It also has the power to hire and dismiss teachers and other school staff.</p><p class="Body">A board can also make rules (bylaws) for the control and management of the school, but these rules will be subject to the Education Act and other Acts, and to the school&#x2019;s charter.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 61, 63B, 75(1)</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span> board&#x2019;s key responsibilities include:</p><ul>

				<li class="Bullet">the principal</li>
				<li class="Bullet">if it&#x2019;s an integrated school, up to four representatives appointed by the school&#x2019;s owner (the owner will be a trust, church or some other body)</li>

It states the school&#x2019;s aims, purposes and specific objectives, and it includes the national aims and objectives from the National Education Guidelines (NEGs).</p><p class="Body">The charter must reflect New Zealand&#x2019;s cultural diversity. It should have a special emphasis on M&#x101;ori culture (tikanga M&#x101;ori) and language (te reo), and it must specifically include the aim of providing teaching in te reo and tikanga M&#x101;ori for students whose parents ask for it.</p><p class="Body">The charter must be made available to parents. The school should also review its charter regularly to make sure it continues to reflect the changing educational needs of students.</p><h4 id="">What can happen if a board doesn&#x2019;t perform adequately?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, Part 7A (ss 78H-78T)</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>here are a range of things the Ministry of Education can do if it thinks the current board is a risk to the operation of the school or to the welfare or educational performance of its students. These include:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">asking the board for specific information</li>
				<li class="Bullet">requiring the board to bring in specialist help</li>
				<li class="Bullet">requiring the board to prepare and carry out an action plan</li>
				<li class="Bullet">appointing a limited statutory manager (an independent temporary manager who takes responsibility for particular aspects of the board&#x2019;s role)</li>
				<li class="Bullet">dissolving the board and appointing a commissioner in its place</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">If you think the Ministry of Education needs to intervene in the board&#x2019;s running of the school, you should contact the Ministry.</p><h4 id="">I have an issue I want to take to the board &#x2013; <span>what should</span> I do?</h4><p class="Body">Usually you should try to talk the issue through with the principal first. However, if you feel you can&#x2019;t approach the principal, or if after approaching them you&#x2019;re not happy with their response, you could:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">phone or write to the chairperson of the board, asking for some time to speak to the board at its next meeting, or</li>
				<li class="Bullet">write to the chairperson explaining the issue and saying what action you would like the board to take. Mark your letter &#x201C;Confidential&#x201D;, and address it to the chairperson, care of the school.</li>
			</ul><h4 id="">I&#x2019;m not happy with the way the board has dealt with <span>an issue</span> &#x2013; what can I do?</h4><p class="Body"><span>A</span>sk the board for a copy of its complaints procedure. Put your complaint in writing, clearly stating the facts relevant to the issue you&#x2019;re complaining about, as well as what you would like done to put things right.</p><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;re not satisfied with the board&#x2019;s response, consider taking your concerns to one of the following government agencies or officials:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Ministry of Education (MOE)</span> &#x2013; The MOE oversees the conduct of all state and integrated schools. Complaints can be lodged with your local Ministry office.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Children&#x2019;s Commissioner </span>&#x2013; The Commissioner&#x2019;s role is to protect the rights of children and young people under the age of 18. They can receive complaints about schools, and can make recommendations to the school.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Education Review Office (ERO)</span> &#x2013; ERO generally visits schools every three years to make sure they&#x2019;re being run properly. ERO doesn&#x2019;t deal with individual complaints, but if several complaints have been received they&#x2019;ll look into the problem when they visit. All complaints will be noted and could affect the school&#x2019;s ERO report, which is a public record. Complaints to ERO should be made in writing.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Ombudsmen</span> &#x2013; The Ombudsmen can investigate complaints about decisions made by boards of trustees, and can make recommendations to the board. While the recommendations aren&#x2019;t legally binding, schools usually take them seriously. The Ombudsmen provide an annual written report to Parliament, which includes the names of schools that have ignored their recommendations.</li>
			</ul><h2 id="">Teachers and staff</h2><h4 id="">What gives teachers the right to discipline their students?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 75</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he Education Act gives a board of trustees complete discretion to control and manage the school, so long as they act consistently with the Act and other New Zealand law. This means that boards have the authority to make reasonable rules, and the teachers they employ can exercise reasonable disciplinary powers and enforce these rules.</p><h4 id="">How can I make a complaint about my child&#x2019;s teacher?</h4><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;re having a problem with a teacher, it&#x2019;s usually best to start by talking to them directly.</p><p class="Body">If that doesn&#x2019;t resolve things, or if you can&#x2019;t speak to them for some reason, the next step is to talk to the principal. If you&#x2019;re still unhappy with how it&#x2019;s being handled, you can go to the school&#x2019;s board of trustees. You can get the details of the chairperson from the school office, and write to them confidentially. If you like, you can ask to be present at the meeting where your issue is discussed.</p><h4 id=""><a id="Anchor-159">Can I take my complaint any further?</a></h4><p class="Body">Yes, in some circumstances you can make a complaint to the Education Council (formerly the Teacher&#x2019;s Council). You can do this if:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">You think the board of trustees won&#x2019;t be able to deal with your issue because of a conflict of interest (for example, if the principal is married to the teacher you want to complain about)</li>
				<li class="Bullet">You have already complained to the principal or board, but you&#x2019;re not satisfied with the way they dealt with your complaint</li>
				<li class="Bullet">The complaint is about a teacher who has left the school</li>
				<li class="Bullet">There are other exceptional circumstances (for example, where the complaint is about incidents involving children who did not attend the teacher&#x2019;s school, or where there is possible criminal offending).</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">The Education Council is responsible for investigating the competence and conduct of teachers. Competence is about whether the teacher meets the criteria to do their job, and is an employment issue. Conduct is about behaviour that is unsafe. Serious misconduct includes things like physically abusing students, inappropriate relationships, neglect and fraud.</p><p class="Body">To make a complaint, you need to fill out their complaint form. You can find this on their website at <a href="http://www.educationcouncil.org.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.educationcouncil.org.nz</span></a><span class="semibold"></span></p><p class="Body">Some important things to note:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">If you haven&#x2019;t taken your complaint to the board of trustees first, the Education Council is likely to refer the matter back to them</li>
				<li class="Bullet">You must provide your name on the complaint form &#x2013; you can&#x2019;t make an anonymous complaint</li>
				<li class="Bullet">The teacher will be given a chance to respond to any accusations you make.</li>
			</ul><h2 id=""><span>Student welfare</span> and safety: The school&#x2019;s obligations</h2><h4 id="">What are the school&#x2019;s obligations to students?</h4><p class="Body">Boards of trustees of state and integrated schools, and the governing bodies of private schools, are responsible for the care of students and for providing a safe learning environment. They have key obligations in the following areas:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss&#xA0;60A, 61, 63; National Administration Guidelines, NAG 2(b), 5 (go to: <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz"><span class="url url">www.minedu.govt.nz</span></a>)</p><span class="Headwords">E</span><span class="Headwords">ducation policy and guidelines</span> &#x2013; School boards are required by government education guidelines to provide a safe physical and emotional environment for students. Schools should have policies to achieve a safe environment, including an anti-bullying policy, and should regularly review these policies.

However, in particular cases, this right may be barred by the ACC laws. Physical injuries, and psychological harm related to physical injuries, are likely to be covered by ACC, and that means you can&#x2019;t bring civil claims in the courts for them. A lawyer will be able to help you understand what options may be available in your case.</li>

This may include allowing students to use the bathrooms matching their gender identity or offering gender neutral (unisex) bathrooms. If you&#x2019;d like your school to review their toilet facilities, you should talk to your teacher or principal, or write to the board of trustees.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Compliance Document for <span>New Zealand</span> Building Code, cl <span>G1 Personal</span> Hygiene</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f a school chooses to offer gender neutral bathrooms, each facility must:</p><ul>

Bans are often impractical, and don&#x2019;t teach children the strategies they need to cope with their allergy.</p><p class="Body">Instead, they recommend four steps:</p><ol>
				<li class="number"><span class="semibold">Medical information.</span> Schools will usually ask for medical information when a student enrols. If they don&#x2019;t, it&#x2019;s important for parents to provide comprehensive information about their child&#x2019;s allergy as soon as possible, including: what their child is allergic to (their allergens), the appropriate first aid response and medications, and emergency contact details (including their doctor). Parents might want to meet with staff to explain this further.</li>
				<li class="number"><span class="semibold">Staff training.</span> Schools must provide a safe environment for students (NAG 5(a)). Staff should be educated about allergies and anaphylaxis (a severe, potentially fatal allergic reaction). They should know the causes of allergic reactions and be confident in recognising them and applying first aid &#x2013; including using adrenaline autoinjectors (EpiPens) if necessary. Face-to-face training is best, but free online training is available from the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy at <a href="http://www.allergy.org.nz"><span class="semibold">www.allergy.org.nz</span></a></li>
				<li class="number"><span class="semibold">Practical strategies.</span> For food allergies, strategies include: no trading or sharing food, clearly labelling lunch boxes and drinks, and teaching about hand washing. For stings and bites, strategies include: taking reasonable measures to decrease plants which attract stinging insects and ensuring children wear appropriate clothing and play in low risk areas.</li>
				<li class="number"><span class="semibold">Education of students and peers.</span> It&#x2019;s mostly a parent&#x2019;s responsibility to teach their child about their allergy and how to look after themselves. However, practical strategies are likely to be more effective if a student&#x2019;s peers are also educated. This can also help combat allergy-related bullying.More information can be found at <a href="http://www.allergy.org.nz"><span class="url url semibold">www.allergy.org.nz</span></a><span class="semibold"></span></li>

However, schools might not need to get consent &#x2013; it might be enough to post a notice in the newsletter or send a letter home.</p><p class="Body">Whether consent is necessary, and what form it needs to take, will depend on the features of the activity, like:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">The duration &#x2013; is it one hour, one day or one week?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">The location &#x2013; on school grounds, in the local community or overseas?</li>

They aren&#x2019;t legally required to have volunteers vetted, but they may choose to. Schools are allowed to make a police check a condition of volunteering.</p><p class="Body">There are other situations where school are required to carry out police checks. Non-teaching employees (like cleaners) must be vetted if they work during normal school hours. Contractors employed to work at the school (for example, doing building work) have to be vetted if they&#x2019;re likely to have unsupervised access to students during normal school hours.</p><p class="Body">Also, registered teachers need to have had a recent satisfactory police check in order to get their practising certificate.</p><h2 id="">Discipline and rules</h2><h4 id="">A typical discipline structure in schools</h4><p class="Body">Many schools use something like the following structure for dealing with disciplinary problems, beginning with individual teachers and then, if necessary, involving more senior school staff:</p><ul>

			</ul><h4 id="">What sorts of behaviour is likely to be against the rules?</h4><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Schools can differ widely in what they expect of their students, and in the sorts of behaviour they find acceptable or unacceptable. For instance, if you question an instruction given by a teacher, some schools might see this as you simply exercising your right to be fully informed &#x2013; but other schools might see this as you being rude and disrespectful.</p><p class="Body"><span>B</span>ehaviour that&#x2019;s likely to be against school rules would include:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">bullying</li>
				<li class="Bullet">fighting</li>
				<li class="Bullet">swearing</li>
				<li class="Bullet">spitting</li>
				<li class="Bullet">being abusive or insulting</li>
				<li class="Bullet">vandalism</li>
				<li class="Bullet">stealing</li>
				<li class="Bullet">behaving in a way that prevents other students or staff from doing their work</li>
				<li class="Bullet">having illegal or banned items, like knives, alcohol, drugs, cigarettes or skateboards</li>
				<li class="Bullet">gambling.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">Schools will also expect students to comply with certain standards &#x2013; for example:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">being on time for class</li>
				<li class="Bullet">being prepared for class, including having the necessary paper, pens and books, and having completed homework and assignments</li>
				<li class="Bullet">participating in class work in a constructive way</li>
				<li class="Bullet">wearing the correct uniform</li>
				<li class="Bullet">bringing notes from parents to explain being away from school.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">Primary school rules may also include things like designated play areas and road safety.</p><h4 id="">No automatic penalties</h4><p class="Body">A school rule can&#x2019;t impose an automatic penalty. If a rule is broken, the school has to take into account all the circumstances of the particular case when it decides how to respond.</p><h3 id="">Scope of the school&#x2019;s authority: When and where you&#x2019;re under its control</h3><h4 id="">Can the school have authority over me outside the gates and outside school hours?</h4><p class="Body">Your school usually doesn&#x2019;t have any authority over you when it&#x2019;s outside school hours, you&#x2019;re not on school grounds, and you&#x2019;re not representing the school in any way. For example, a school couldn&#x2019;t suspend you for smoking cannabis at a private party at the weekend.</p><p class="Body">In some situations the school could still have authority over you even though it&#x2019;s outside school hours and you&#x2019;re not on school grounds. For example:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">In uniform / representing the school</span> &#x2013; If you&#x2019;re wearing school uniform you can generally be seen as representing the school, and therefore the school probably has authority over you. However, this hasn&#x2019;t yet been tested in the New Zealand courts so the law is unclear.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">On school trips</span> &#x2013; When you&#x2019;re on a school trip the school will have authority over you. Your parents will usually be asked to sign an agreement before the trip.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">At special school events</span> &#x2013; If for example you&#x2019;re at a school ball, the school will have authority over you.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Travelling to and from school</span> &#x2013; In general, you&#x2019;re under the school&#x2019;s control during journeys to and from school. This clearly includes when you&#x2019;re travelling on school buses, but possibly also when you&#x2019;re using public transport or walking or biking to and from school. You won&#x2019;t be under the school&#x2019;s control if you&#x2019;re picked up or dropped off by your parents.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Damaging the school&#x2019;s reputation &#x2013; </span>A school may be able to punish if you harm its reputation outside school hours &#x2013; for example, if you made serious accusations online about school staff or other students. However, the courts haven&#x2019;t decided this question so it&#x2019;s unclear.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">Whether a school has control over you when you&#x2019;re outside the school gates could also depend on other factors like:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Distance from the school </span>&#x2013; For example, a school could punish you if you swore at a teacher just outside the school gate, or if someone who lived nearby told the school they saw a group of students taking fruit from their trees on their way home.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Safety issues</span> &#x2013; For example, a school could punish if you were seen near the school, just after school finished, throwing stones from a bridge on to cars below.</li>
			</ul><h2 id=""><a id="Anchor-158">Punishments</a></h2><h3 id="">School punishments that are legal</h3><h4 id="">Written work</h4><p class="Body">Any written work the school gives as a punishment, such as lines and essays, should be reasonable and should take into account the particular student and their ability. For example, a dyslexic student shouldn&#x2019;t be punished by being given extra writing to do.</p><h4 id="">Detentions</h4><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;re given a detention outside school hours, it&#x2019;s good practice for schools to give your parents advance notice, so they can make any necessary arrangements. The school can assume that your parents agree to the detention if they don&#x2019;t tell the school they object.</p><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;re given a lunchtime detention, you should still be given enough time to have lunch and go to the toilet.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 22</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>t&#x2019;s quite common for schools to give a whole class a detention &#x2013; &#x201C;until someone owns up&#x201D; or &#x201C;because so many have been talking&#x201D;. However, these whole class detentions may breach the Bill of Rights, which says a person can&#x2019;t be detained &#x201C;arbitrarily&#x201D; &#x2013; that is, without a good reason.</p><h4 id="">Extra work around school</h4><p class="Body">This can involve things like picking up rubbish, or sweeping and general cleaning.</p><p class="Body">However, this work shouldn&#x2019;t be done in normal class time and you must be given the equipment necessary for the job &#x2013; for example, gloves for dealing with unpleasant rubbish. The school must make sure you&#x2019;re safe.</p><h4 id="">Time-out, or sending students out of class</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 3</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span>lthough &#x201C;time-outs&#x201D; can be helpful for both the student and the teacher, by giving a chance for the situation to cool down, they must be used carefully and not for long periods. Everyone in New Zealand over the age of five is entitled to an education, and sending students outside the classroom may violate this right if this is done too often.</p><p class="Body">When deciding whether to use a time-out, teachers should take into account the psychological impact this would have on the particular student. Relevant factors will be how long the student will be kept isolated from other students and what the time-out room is like &#x2013; that is, how big it is, and whether it has natural light and proper ventilation.</p><h4 id="">Taking away privileges</h4><p class="Body">A school shouldn&#x2019;t take away a privilege from you if this could affect your education. For example, you shouldn&#x2019;t be punished by being kept back from a trip to see a play or film that&#x2019;s part of the English syllabus. The sorts of privileges that can be taken away are:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">going to a sports game</li>
				<li class="Bullet">going to a school dance (but only if it&#x2019;s one organised by the school, rather than by, for example, the Parent Teachers Association or another group as a fundraising exercise)</li>
				<li class="Bullet">going on a class outing, like a picnic.</li>
			</ul><h4 id="">Behaviour management programmes</h4><p class="Body">Programmes that help students learn self-discipline or change their behaviour &#x2013; like anger-management and drug-awareness programmes &#x2013; can be creative ways of helping students with behavioural problems. However, they shouldn&#x2019;t be seen as a form of punishment but rather as a potentially effective tool for changing behaviour.</p><h4 id="">Being told off (reprimanded) in front of the principal and your parents</h4><p class="Body">This can be compared to a &#x201C;caution&#x201D; under the youth justice system when young people are warned at the police station by a senior police officer in front of their parents. In the school situation, a reprimand can take place in the principal&#x2019;s office.</p><h4 id="">Daily reports</h4><p class="Body">The school can monitor a student&#x2019;s behaviour through daily reports. Teachers fill in a report card and at the end of each day show it to the principal, deputy principal, dean or a nominated teacher.</p><h4 id="">Behavioural contracts</h4><p class="Body">Behavioural contracts are usually drawn up as a condition when a student goes back to school after they&#x2019;ve been suspended (<a href="3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.html#Anchor-152">see &#x201C;Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions&#x201D;, page 64</a>).</p><p class="Body">The contract should be negotiated with you and your parents, rather than simply being imposed on you. It should be a two-way agreement, recognising the school&#x2019;s duty to provide you with guidance and counselling as well as the conditions that you and your parents agree to.</p><p class="Body">The contract should say exactly what&#x2019;s expected of you, and set out some goals. These should be reasonable, realistic and achievable &#x2013; you shouldn&#x2019;t be set up to fail.</p><p class="Body">If you breach the contract, the principal may ask the board of trustees to hold another meeting to discuss the situation. It shouldn&#x2019;t be a condition of the contract that your parents have to withdraw you from the school if you don&#x2019;t keep to the contract. Each case must be treated individually. The only way a school can suspend, exclude or expel you is through the school suspension/expulsion process (<a href="3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.html#Anchor-153">see &#x201C;When and how can a student be prevented from attending school?&#x201D;, page 65</a>).</p><h3 id="">Punishments that are illegal or suspect</h3><h4 id="">Physical (&#x201C;corporal&#x201D;) punishments</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 139A; <span>Summary Offences</span> Act 1981, s 9</p><p class="Body"><span>P</span>hysical punishments are illegal &#x2013; this includes all correction or punishment involving physical force, like hitting or slapping you, or using a strap or cane, or throwing things at you like pens or whiteboard erasers. Any deliberate use of force, or attempted force, against you could be an assault and therefore could justify a criminal complaint to the police, even if you&#x2019;re not hurt.</p><p class="Body">If you have in fact been injured, however, your parents should promptly take you to a doctor for a medical certificate. This can be used as part of a complaint to the school, or as evidence if criminal charges are laid.</p><h4 id="">Sending the student home</h4><p class="Body">Your school can&#x2019;t send you home, even if only for a day or part of a day, unless the principal uses the formal stand-down or suspension process, and the necessary grounds for stand-down or suspension exist.</p><p class="Body">You shouldn&#x2019;t be sent home for trivial reasons like an incorrect uniform, or because the school doesn&#x2019;t have the resources to deal with your special needs. These aren&#x2019;t grounds that can justify a stand-down or suspension. The process and necessary grounds are explained in the chapter on stand-downs and suspensions from <a href="3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.html#Anchor-152">page 64</a>.</p><h4 id="">Punishments that are cruel or degrading</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 9</p><p class="Body"><span>C</span>ruel or degrading punishments are against the Bill of Rights. Examples include a teacher putting you down in front of the class, or making you stand or hold your arms above your head for a long period. Asking you to make an apology in front of the whole school might also fall into this category.</p><h4 id="">&#x201C;In-school&#x201D; suspensions</h4><p class="Body">An &#x201C;in-school suspension&#x201D; is when the school, rather than sending you home, gets you to do work around the school for a day or two, instead of attending class. Arguably, this type of &#x201C;suspension&#x201D; is illegal, because if you&#x2019;re attending school you have the right to take part in educational activities there.</p><p class="Body">However, if you&#x2019;ve been officially suspended, it&#x2019;s legal for the school to ask you to return to school to participate in counselling or an educational programme that will help deal with your behaviour. A principal can also allow a suspended student to return to school to sit exams, if the parents have asked for this.</p><h4 id="">Using the power to excuse attendance as a means of punishment</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 27</p><p class="Body"><span>P</span>rincipals have the power to excuse a student from attending school for short periods (up to five days) if the principal thinks this is justified &#x2013; this might be used, for example, to allow you to attend a funeral or tangihanga. Schools can&#x2019;t use this power to send you home for misbehaving: students who misbehave can only be removed from school if the principal uses the formal stand-down or suspension process (again, <a href="3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.html#Anchor-152">see &#x201C;Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions&#x201D;, page 64</a>).</p><h3 id="">Taking action about illegal or inappropriate punishments</h3><h4 id="">What can I do if I&#x2019;m not happy about a punishment?</h4><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;re not happy about a punishment that your school has given you, you and your parents could raise this with the school.</p><p class="Body">Parents should make sure they&#x2019;re aware of all the facts, and should ask the school for an explanation.</p><p class="Body">You could suggest alternative types of discipline that you think will be more appropriate.</p><h4 id="">Outside agencies that can help</h4><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;re not happy with the school&#x2019;s response to your complaint about a punishment, you could contact an agency who can help you, such as:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">the Children&#x2019;s Commissioner</li>
				<li class="Bullet">your local Community Law Centre</li>
				<li class="Bullet">your local Citizens Advice Bureau</li>
				<li class="Bullet">the Student Rights Service (or SRS. Formerly called the Parents Legal Information Line) 0800 499 488</li>
				<li class="Bullet">a specialist advocacy service like IHC or CCS</li>
				<li class="Bullet">the Education Review Office (ERO).</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">For contact details, <a href="7. Fixing problems and making complaints.html#Anchor-154">see &#x201C;Useful contacts&#x201D;, page 139</a>.</p><p class="Body">It may be that the punishment was illegal, or breached the school&#x2019;s charter or the National Administration Guidelines. The Student Rights Service, the Children&#x2019;s Commissioner or your local Community Law Centre can tell you about this.</p><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: The Education Review Office (ERO) is a body that checks whether a school is running as it should. If you send ERO a written complaint, they&#x2019;ll file it and then check these concerns when its officers visit the school. However, if the complaint is particularly serious, or a number of students or parents voice the same concern, ERO can order a special audit of the school, or bring a planned audit forward.</p><p class="Body">If the punishment was legal, but you think it was too severe or inappropriate, or that your version of events wasn&#x2019;t taken into account, you should approach the teacher concerned. If you&#x2019;re not satisfied with the explanation, complain to the principal. You&#x2019;re also entitled to take your concerns to the board of trustees &#x2013; you should do this in writing and address your letter to the chairperson.</p><h2 id=""><span>S</span>tudents&#x2019; rights in the disciplinary process: <span>Natural justice</span> principles</h2><h4 id="">What rights does a student have in the discipline process?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990, s 27</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he law sets out specific processes that schools have to follow when standing down, suspending or expelling students (see <a href="3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.html#Anchor-152">see &#x201C;Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions&#x201D;, page 64</a>). But in all situations when students are being disciplined by schools, even when the law doesn&#x2019;t set out detailed processes, students have the protection of some basic legal principles &#x2013; called &#x201C;natural justice&#x201D;. In short, natural justice means you have to be treated fairly, and decisions affecting your rights (a suspension for example) should be made using fair processes.</p><p class="Body">These natural justice principles are guaranteed under the Bill of Rights, which covers all bodies and individuals that are carrying out a public judicial (that is, court-like) function &#x2013; this includes teachers, principals and school boards making disciplinary decisions.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 13(c)</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he part of the Education Act that deals with stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions specifically refers to natural justice, saying that one of the purposes of that part of the Act is to make sure that natural justice principles are followed in <span>these cases</span>.</p><h4 id="">What are the principles of natural justice that apply to students?</h4><p class="Body">Natural justice will usually require a school to do the following things when disciplining a student:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Right to be heard</span> &#x2013; You have the right to speak and be heard. If a teacher thinks you&#x2019;ve broken a school rule, they should talk to you and tell you exactly what the problem is and how the rule has been breached. They should also explain the effects of what you&#x2019;ve done, if any, on others at the school. You should then be given a chance to explain what happened. You should only be punished if you can&#x2019;t give a reasonable explanation.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">No prejudging</span> &#x2013; The school has to approach its decision with an open mind, without prejudging your case.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">No bias or personal motives </span>&#x2013; The school has to make its decision without bias and in good faith, without any personal malice towards you or any other improper motives.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Flexibility</span> &#x2013; When it&#x2019;s deciding how to deal with any misconduct or rule-breaking, the school can&#x2019;t follow an inflexible rule or policy (for example that any student found with alcohol will be suspended). The school has to consider your particular circumstances, weigh up all the factors, and consider all the available options.</li>
			</ul><h2 id=""><a id="Anchor-167">Restorative justice</a></h2><p class="Body">Restorative justice is a way of thinking about and responding to harm. It&#x2019;s an alternative way of managing relationships which originated in the criminal justice system. It can be used in a school setting in response to misconduct, and to reduce the number of stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.</p><p class="Body">It involves a different way of looking at things &#x2013; the focus is not on punishment but on repairing harm and restoring relationships. A key principle is that the whole school community works together to both develop rules and to find ways to move forward when rules are broken.</p><h4 id="">What is a restorative approach?</h4><p class="Body">Depending on the situation and misbehaviour, it could range from an informal chat to a sit-down conference.</p><p class="Body">It can involve the person who has caused harm, the person harmed, school staff, wh&#x101;nau, community members and, if necessary, the police. The purpose is to establish what harm was caused, why it was done, the wider emotional context, what is needed to put things right, and how the situation can be avoided in the future.</p><p class="Body">It allows everyone involved to meet and gain a better understanding of the impact of the incident, the reasons it happened and the preferred outcomes.</p><h4 id="">Is it easy for schools to implement restorative justice?</h4><p class="Body">Not necessarily. It works best if the school is willing to invest time and resources. Schools will need to engage in a school-wide cultural change, which will involve staff training and regular evaluation. But schools who have done it suggest that it is worth the effort. Restorative justice fosters a culture of respect, takes a lot of stress out of the day-to-day school environment, and encourages high levels of student engagement.</p><h4 id="">My child is the victim of bullying. If they have to face their bully, will they just get bullied more?</h4><p class="Body">No, not if the process is followed properly. Restorative justice focuses on victims&#x2019; needs, which many find empowering. Instead of making distressed people re-live trauma, restorative practice can give them the opportunity to express their anger and have their questions answered so they can move on.</p><p class="Body">When young people are asked what they need when they have been harmed, their answers tend to be similar: someone to listen, time to calm down, acknowledgement of the impact, a sincere apology and reassurance it won&#x2019;t happen again. Restorative approaches can meet all these needs.</p><h4 id="">My child often gets in trouble but their teachers never listen to their side of the story. How would restorative justice help?</h4><p class="Body">When a young person behaves in a way that is challenging for a teacher, it&#x2019;s likely that both student and teacher will feel some kind of grievance. Unless both feel heard and understood, it&#x2019;s possible that the relationship between teacher and student will be damaged, affecting the way they work together in the future.</p><p class="Body">Restorative justice allows a young person who has caused harm, on purpose or deliberately: time to think, a chance to explain, an opportunity to apologise, a chance to make amends, and reassurance the matter is dealt with and they can move on. More traditional, punitive approaches rarely provide the kind of environment that can meet these needs.</p><h4 id="">Is it a soft option?</h4><p class="Body">Not really. Restorative approaches are often more challenging, as students must face up to their shortcomings and are held to account in front of people who matter <span>to them</span>.</p><h4 id="">Key differences between restorative justice and traditional approaches to discipline</h4><h4 id="">More <span class="Heading-4-Char char-style-override-11">information</span></h4><p class="Body">Sean Buckley and Gabrielle Maxwell <span class="itals">Respectful Schools: Restorative Practices in Education </span>(Office of the Children&#x2019;s Commissioner and The Institute of Policy Studies, Victoria University, Wellington, January 2007). <a href="http://www.occ.org.nz/publications"><span class="url semibold">www.occ.org.nz/publications</span></a><span class="semibold"></span></p><p class="Body">Restorative Schools: <a href="http://www.restorativeschools.org.nz/resources"><span class="url semibold">www.restorativeschools.org.nz/resources</span></a><span class="semibold"></span></p><p class="Body">Restorative Justice in New Zealand: <a href="http://www.restorativejusticeaotearoa.org.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.restorativejusticeaotearoa.org.nz</span></a><span class="semibold"></span></p><p class="Body">Te Kotahitanga: <a href="http://www.tekotahitanga.tki.org.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.tekotahitanga.tki.org.nz</span></a><span class="semibold"></span></p><p class="Body">Positive Behaviour for Learning Restorative Practice: <a href="http://www.pb4l.tki.org.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.pb</span><span class="semibold">4l.tki.org.nz</span></a><span class="itals char-style-override-8"></span></p></div>
