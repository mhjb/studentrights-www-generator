<h1>6. Parents and schools</h1><h2 id="">Your right to be kept informed by the school</h2><h4 id="">When should I be told about my child&#x2019;s progress and any problems?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">National Administration Guidelines (NAGs) 2, 2A</p><p class="Body"><span>S</span>chools have to report on a student&#x2019;s progress and achievements to the student and to their parents. For students enrolled in years 1&#x2013;8, schools must also provide a written report on the student&#x2019;s progress and achievement in relation to the National Standards, at least twice a year.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 77(b), and ss 60, 92 (&#x201C;parent&#x201D; definition)</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he principal has to take all reasonable steps to tell a student&#x2019;s parents if there are problems that are preventing or slowing a student&#x2019;s progress through school, or that are harming the student&#x2019;s relationships with teachers or other students. Both parents must be told, even if the student only lives with one parent. &#x201C;Parent&#x201D; here also includes guardians and immediate caregivers.</p><a href="5.  Information and privacy.html#Anchor-175"><span class="xref">arents getting information from the school, see </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">116</span></a><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f you feel the school hasn&#x2019;t kept you well-informed, ask the principal for an explanation. Make sure the school knows how to contact you, and make it clear to them that you want and expect the school to keep you informed.</p><h2 id="">Separated parents</h2><h4 id="">If my child doesn&#x2019;t live with me at all, can I still access information held at their school?</h4><p class="Body">Yes. All parents, including those who don&#x2019;t have day-to-day care of their child, and all non-parent guardians, should usually:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">be given copies of their child&#x2019;s school reports</li>
				<li class="Bullet">be able to participate in PTA and other school functions</li>
				<li class="Bullet">get information about school trips, camps and other activities</li>
				<li class="Bullet">be contacted by the school if urgent medical treatment is necessary</li>
				<li class="Bullet">be able to attend parent-teacher interviews (parents who are separated can ask that these be held separately for each parent).</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">Depending on their age and maturity, students may withhold their consent to information being given to their non-custodial parent. Schools may withhold information on these grounds.</p><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">For more details about this area, <a href="5.  Information and privacy.html#Anchor-175">see &#x201C;Parents getting information from the school&#x201D;, page 116</a>.</p><p class="Body">However, schools will have to follow any court order or written parenting agreement that deals with the release of information to either parent.</p><h4 id="">What happens when separated parents can&#x2019;t agree on aspects of their child&#x2019;s schooling?</h4><p class="Body">If parents can&#x2019;t agree, either of them can apply for a Family Court order to decide the issue.</p><p class="Body">This may include:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Religious education</span> &#x2013; Schools can generally rely on one parent&#x2019;s permission for the child to attend religious education. However, if there&#x2019;s a disagreement, the school should try to get permission from both parents, or follow any relevant court order.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="itals">L v H</span> (1996)</p><span class="Headwords">P</span><span class="Headwords">hotographs &#x2013; </span>Schools can provide photographs to parents, unless there&#x2019;s a court order preventing it. In one case where a father who didn&#x2019;t have day-to-day care asked for photographs of his child, the judge refused this, ruling that the father&#x2019;s request was for his own benefit, not the child&#x2019;s, who was actually frightened of him.</li>
			</ul><h2 id=""><span>Trespass: Being</span> banned from school grounds</h2><h4 id="">Can I be ordered off school grounds?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Trespass Act 1980, ss 3-5</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span>ny occupier of a property, or one of their employees, can legally order a person to leave and stay off the property, and this means that the school principal, or a board member or any staff member probably has the authority to do this. Other people &#x2013; another parent, for example &#x2013; won&#x2019;t have the legal authority to do this.</p><p class="Body">There are two kinds of trespass notices, warnings to leave and warnings to stay off. Both kinds can be given either verbally or in writing. They don&#x2019;t have to follow a set form or use a set form of words.</p><h4 id="">Being warned to leave</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Trespass Act 1980, s 3</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f you&#x2019;ve warned to leave you must leave the school grounds immediately. If you refuse, this is a criminal offence. However, once you leave, you&#x2019;re free to return later, unless you&#x2019;ve also been given a warning to stay off.</p><h4 id="">Being warned to stay off</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Trespass Act 1980, s 4</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span> warning to stay off bans you from returning to the school for two years. If you do come back within that time, it&#x2019;s a criminal offence.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="itals">Russell v Police</span> (1981) 1 NZCPR 349.</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f the school intends to warn you to stay off rather than simply warning you to leave, they should be clear that this is what they mean. If they simply say &#x201C;You have to leave&#x201D;, this probably isn&#x2019;t enough to ban you from returning to the school for two years. It is best if they advise you in writing, but they could also say something like: &#x201C;You must leave and you are not welcome back.&#x201D;</p><h4 id="">What are the penalties for breaching the trespass laws?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Trespass Act 1980, ss 3, 4, 11(2)(a)</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f you&#x2019;re convicted in court of staying on the school grounds after being warned to leave, or of coming back to the school within two years after being warned to stay off, you can be fined up to $1,000 or jailed for up to three months.</p><p class="Body">However, you won&#x2019;t be convicted if it was necessary for you to be on the school grounds because there some emergency, or for your own protection or to protect someone else.<span class="itals char-style-override-4"></span></p></div>
