<h1>3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions</h1><h2 id="">Overview: When you can be removed from school</h2><h4 id=""><a id="Anchor-153">When and how can a student be prevented from attending school?</a></h4><p class="Body">A student can only be prevented from attending a state or integrated school in one of the following ways:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Stand-downs</span> &#x2013; This is a formal removal of a student from school for a short period, which can be up to 10 days.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Suspensions</span> &#x2013; This is the formal removal of a student from school, usually for longer periods than for stand-downs and usually for more serious types of misbehaviour. The initial decision to suspend the student is made by the principal, and after that the board of trustees must meet to decide what to do about the student. The board can lift the suspension, or extend it with conditions, or exclude or expel the student.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Exclusions / expulsions </span>&#x2013; &#x201C;Exclusion&#x201D; is the formal and permanent removal of a student who is under 16, while &#x201C;expulsion&#x201D; is the word used if the student is 16 or older. A student can only be excluded or expelled in the most serious cases. When a student is &#x201C;excluded&#x201D;, the principal has to try to arrange for them to go to another school, and if the principal can&#x2019;t do this then the Ministry of Education will help. When a student is &#x201C;expelled&#x201D;, the<span class="Headwords"> </span>principal and the Ministry don&#x2019;t have to help them find a new school.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Different laws apply to being suspended or expelled from a private school (<a href="3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.html#Anchor-171">see &#x201C;Private schools: Suspensions and expulsions&#x201D;, page 90</a>) and from school boarding hostels (<a href="4. Specific areas of control and discipline.html#Anchor-172">see &#x201C;What happens if a boarder breaches a hostel rule?&#x201D;, page 111</a>).</p><span class="Headwords">Being kept away on health grounds</span> &#x2013; The principal can send a student home if they&#x2019;re not clean enough or if they could have an infectious disease (<a href="3.

			</ul><h4 id=""><span>A</span>re there other legal ways of removing a student from school?</h4><p class="Body">No. It&#x2019;s illegal for a school to use some other method to remove you from school for disciplinary reasons, like sending you home without following the proper stand-down or suspension process, or encouraging your parents to voluntarily withdraw you from school (<a href="3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.html#Anchor-163">see &#x201C;Illegal suspensions&#x201D;, page 88</a>).</p><h2 id="">Stand-downs: <span>Short-term</span> removal from school</h2><h4 id="">What is a &#x201C;stand-down&#x201D;?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 14, 18(1); Education (Stand-Down, Suspension, Exclusion, and Expulsion) Rules 1999, rule 9</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span> stand-down is when you&#x2019;re formally removed from school by the principal for a short period. It can be for up to 10 days, but it&#x2019;s usually only one to three days. Stand-downs are intended to give you, your parents and the school time to look at what&#x2019;s happened and work out how to stop it happening again. Sometimes there&#x2019;ll be a stand-down meeting for you and your parents to discuss this with the principal.</p><p class="Body">The principal must immediately tell your parents about the stand-down, the reasons for it, and how long the stand-down is for. You and your parents must also be given information sheets on stand-downs.</p><p class="Body">Only the principal or acting principal can stand you down. Deputy principals, deans and other teachers can&#x2019;t do it.</p><h4 id=""><a id="Anchor-146">On what grounds can I be stood down from school?</a></h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14(1)</p><p class="Body"><span>Y</span>ou can only be stood down for:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">gross misconduct that&#x2019;s harmful or dangerous to other students, or</li>
				<li class="Bullet">continual disobedience that&#x2019;s harmful or dangerous to other students, or</li>
				<li class="Bullet">behaviour that&#x2019;s likely to cause serious harm to you or to other students if you&#x2019;re not stood down.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">These are the same grounds as for suspensions, but stand-downs are generally given for less serious types of misbehaviour &#x2013; most often for continual disobedience, or for assaulting other students, or for abusing teachers. Stand-downs usually happen in secondary schools.</p><h4 id="">How long can I be stood down for?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14(2)</p><p class="Body"><span>S</span>tand-downs are usually for one to three days, but you can be stood down for a maximum of five days in a single school term or a maximum of 10 days in a school year.</p><p class="Body">You can be stood down more than once, so long as the total days stood down aren&#x2019;t more than five days in a term or 10 days in a year.</p><p class="Body">The day you&#x2019;re stood down, and any non-school days, aren&#x2019;t counted.</p><p class="Body">Before the stand-down comes to an end, the principal can decide, for any reason, to shorten it and allow you to return to school.</p><h4 id="">If I&#x2019;m stood down, will I be sent home immediately?</h4><p class="Body">The principal can send you home for the rest of the day as soon as they make the stand-down decision, or they can decide that you&#x2019;ll remain at school until the end of that school day, in which case you have to be supervised. When deciding whether to send you home immediately, the Ministry of Education has advised that principals should consider your age and your parents&#x2019; situation.</p><h4 id="">Stand-down meetings</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education (Stand-Down, Suspension, Exclusion, and Expulsion) Rules 1999, rules 11, 12</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f you&#x2019;re stood down, the principal can call a stand-down meeting. The purpose is to discuss and share information about what led to the problem and what can be done to address your behaviour at school. The principal may also want to discuss what the school will expect of you when you&#x2019;re back at school.</p><p class="Body">You or your parents can also ask for a stand-down meeting, and the principal must then arrange one as soon as practicable. At the meeting, you and your parents can provide reasons why you think the stand-down should be lifted or shortened. The principal can decide to cancel the stand-down if they decide it wasn&#x2019;t in fact justified.</p><h4 id=""><a id="Anchor-168">C<a id="Anchor-128">an I go to school during a stand-down if necessary?</a></a></h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14(3)</p><p class="Body"><span>Y</span>es. You or your parents can ask for you to be allowed to attend school for a time for particular reasons &#x2013; for example, to sit exams, fulfil a course requirement, or have guidance and counselling. If the principal thinks the request is reasonable they must agree to it.</p><p class="Body">Once the principal agrees to this, you have to go to school at the relevant times, or else you&#x2019;ll be considered truant.</p><p class="Body">There may be other situations when you could be allowed on school grounds. Talk to the principal about this &#x2013; they have to agree to any reasonable request.</p><h4 id="">What are my rights while I&#x2019;m stood down?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 17A(1)</p><p class="Body"><span>Y</span>ou stay on the school roll while you&#x2019;re stood down, and the principal must make sure you get guidance and counselling.</p><h2 id=""><a id="Anchor-173">S<a id="Anchor-129">uspensions</a></a></h2><h4 id="">What is a suspension?</h4><p class="Body">A suspension is you&#x2019;re formally removed from school by the school, initially by the principal but then by the board of trustees if the board decides to extend the suspension. Whereas stand-downs are usually only for several days, a suspension can be a week or more. Compared to stand-downs, suspensions are generally given for more serious misbehaviour, and in the most serious cases they can lead to the board deciding to permanently &#x201C;exclude&#x201D; or &#x201C;expel&#x201D; the student.</p><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: In 2014, approximately 45% of suspensions were lifted at the suspension meeting (within 7 school days of the initial decision). Around 37% of students were excluded or expelled. The remaining 17% of suspensions were extended beyond <span>the first week</span>.</p><p class="Body"></p><h3 id="">When a student can be suspended</h3><h4 id=""><a id="Anchor-196">Wha<a id="Anchor-130">t types of behaviour can justify a suspension?</a></a></h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14(1)</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span> principal can suspend you if your behaviour fits into one of the following three categories:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">gross misconduct that&#x2019;s a harmful or dangerous example to other students</li>
				<li class="Bullet">continual disobedience that&#x2019;s a harmful or dangerous example to other students</li>
				<li class="Bullet">behaviour that is likely to cause serious harm to you or to other students if you&#x2019;re not suspended.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">&#x201C;Gross misconduct&#x201D; and &#x201C;continual disobedience&#x201D; are explained in detail below.</p><p class="Body">Those three grounds are the same as for stand-downs, but suspensions are generally used for more serious cases.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">D v Havill and Board of Trustees of Western Springs College (2009)</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he principal, and later the board if it extends the suspension, must specifically identify which of these three grounds they believe applies to the particular case. If they don&#x2019;t do this, the suspension is invalid and you can&#x2019;t be prevented from attending school.</p><p class="Body">A principal must choose either to stand-down or to suspend a student, and must follow through with the required legal process for the particular course they choose &#x2013; they can&#x2019;t do both.</p><h4 id="">What is &#x201C;gross misconduct&#x201D;?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14(1)(a); M &amp; R v Syms and the Board of Trustees of Palmerston North Boys&#x2019; High School (December 1990) [2003] NZAR 705</p><p class="Body">&#x201C;Gross misconduct&#x201D; is serious misbehaviour. The courts have said it must be &#x201C;striking and reprehensible to a high degree&#x201D;, and not just trivial behaviour that children or teenagers could be expected to engage in every now and then. The misconduct must be serious enough to justify removing you from school even though this might harm your education.</p><p class="Body">Whether an incident is gross misconduct will always depend on the particular situation. For example, in a case where students on a school ski trip were suspended for drinking alcohol, the judge said that whether drinking alcohol amounted to &#x201C;gross misconduct&#x201D; would depend on all the circumstances, and the school had to consider questions such as who had obtained the alcohol, how much was consumed, and whether the student was drunk.</p><p class="Body">School policies can&#x2019;t automatically label a particular type of behaviour as gross misconduct. The Education Act gives schools a discretion that shouldn&#x2019;t be restricted by self-imposed rules that don&#x2019;t allow for any exceptions. The school must allow for students&#x2019; individual needs and problems &#x2013; for example:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">A student who steals might be from a disadvantaged background and be hungry.</li>
				<li class="Bullet">A student who has recently suffered some kind of trauma may need some leniency.</li>
				<li class="Bullet">A student who behaved destructively might require help rather than punishment.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">You can&#x2019;t be suspended for gross misconduct unless your behaviour amounts to a dangerous or harmful example to other students.</p><h4 id="">What is &#x201C;continual disobedience&#x201D;?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14(1)(a); J v Board of Trustees of Lynfield College (2007)</p><p class="Body"><span>C</span>ontinual disobedience is when<span class="semibold"> </span>you regularly and deliberately ignore rules or refuse to do what you&#x2019;re told. It&#x2019;s not continual disobedience if you merely respond slowly or don&#x2019;t do what you&#x2019;re told: there must be an element of deliberate non-cooperation or defiance, and it has to happen more than once.</p><p class="Body">Continual disobedience isn&#x2019;t enough by itself for a suspension or stand-down &#x2013; the behaviour must also be a harmful or dangerous example to other students. The school should consider whether your disobedience would undermine discipline and safety standards in the school if you&#x2019;re not suspended.</p><h4 id="">The principal&#x2019;s decision</h4><p class="Body">The principal has to follow the rules of natural justice &#x2013; basically this means they must act fairly at all times, must listen to and consider what you have to say without prejudging the situation, and can&#x2019;t rely on any information or factors that are irrelevant to the case at hand.</p><p class="Body">The principal should try to understand the context by considering any relevant information the school has and that parents may be able to provide. The principal isn&#x2019;t legally required to talk to your parents before suspending you, but this may be a good idea. The information the principal has must be reliable enough to meet one of the three possible suspension grounds.</p><p class="Body">It&#x2019;s the role of the board of trustees to review the principal&#x2019;s decision at the suspension meeting.</p><h4 id="">Can the principal suspend one student involved in an incident, but not another?</h4><p class="Body">The principal has to consider all the circumstances and factors. Although two students may have done the same thing, it may in fact be fair to treat each student differently.</p><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;ve been suspended but another student who was also involved in the wrongdoing wasn&#x2019;t suspended, you can raise this issue with the board of trustees at its suspension meeting (see &#x201C;The board of trustees&#x2019; suspension meeting&#x201D; below). Be prepared to given reasons why you should be treated the same as the other student and be allowed to return to school; you could make some suggestions for alternative measures for the board to consider, like in-school punishments.</p><h4 id="">What are my rights if I have special needs?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Human Rights Act 1993</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>t may be illegal discrimination if you were suspended for behaviour that you couldn&#x2019;t really help and that was the result of your disability. Even if the suspension is justified, it could still be illegal discrimination if the school didn&#x2019;t have an appropriate behavioural plan for you and effectively set you up to fail.</p><p class="Body">The question to ask is whether the school has done everything reasonable to meet your needs, taking into account the school&#x2019;s obligation to maintain a safe environment for you and other students.</p><h3 id="">What happens after the principal suspends a student</h3><h4 id="">Principal must notify the parents, the board and the Ministry</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 18(2); <span class="itals">D v Havill and Board of Trustees of Western Springs College</span> (2009)</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span>fter suspending you the principal must immediately inform your parents, the board of trustees and the Ministry of Education. The principal has to state the reasons for the suspension &#x2013; this includes explaining specifically which of the three suspension grounds they&#x2019;re relying on and how what you did meets that ground (see above, &#x201C;What types of behaviour can justify a suspension?&#x201D;).</p><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Because suspended students stay on the school roll, the principal has to take all reasonable, practicable steps to provide you with guidance and counselling, in order to minimise the disruption to your education and facilitate your return to school when that&#x2019;s appropriate.</p><p class="Body"></p><p class="Body">The issue then goes to the board of trustees for a decision (see below).</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 13(b), 17A</p><h4 id=""><span>W</span>hen will the board of trustees meet and make a decision?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 15(4); Education (Stand-Down, Suspension, Exclusion, and Expulsion) Rules 1999, rule 15(3)</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f the principal has suspended you, you stay suspended until the board of trustees holds a suspension meeting to decide what will happen. The meeting must happen within seven school days after the suspension, or within 10 calendar days after it if you were suspended less than seven school days before the end of term. The day on which you were suspended isn&#x2019;t counted.</p><p class="Body">If, for example, you&#x2019;re told on a Tuesday afternoon that you&#x2019;re suspended, the first of the seven school days would be the Wednesday, even if a letter formally notifying you and your family doesn&#x2019;t arrive for another few days.</p><p class="Body">The board has to hold the suspension meeting and make a final decision by the time limit. If it doesn&#x2019;t, the suspension is over and you can go back to school. The meeting and decision can&#x2019;t be delayed, even if both sides agree to put it off. The meeting can go ahead without you and your family being there (as long as the family had 48 hours&#x2019; notice).</p><h4 id="">Getting notice of the suspension meeting and other information</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education (Stand-Down, Suspension, Exclusion, and Expulsion) Rules 1999, rule 15</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span>s soon as possible, the board must let you and your parents know, in writing, the time and the place of the meeting. The board has to make sure you get this information at least 48 hours before the suspension meeting. This 48-hour period can only be reduced if everyone agrees.</p><p class="Body">The information provided to you must be as complete as possible, and must include:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">information about the procedure at the suspension meeting</li>
				<li class="Bullet">a copy of the principal&#x2019;s report to the board giving the reasons for the suspension</li>
				<li class="Bullet">any other material about the suspension that will be presented at the meeting</li>
				<li class="Bullet">the options available to the board.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">The principles of natural justice require that you get a fair hearing. If you become aware that a board member has a potential bias (for example, they&#x2019;re related to someone involved in the incident), you should contact the board&#x2019;s chairperson promptly to let them know this and suggest that the board member shouldn&#x2019;t participate in the meeting and the board&#x2019;s decision.</p><h4 id="">What if the parents withdraw the student from school before the board meeting?</h4><p class="Body">Parents shouldn&#x2019;t be hasty in withdrawing their child from school to avoid them being excluded or expelled, as this can in fact leave the student worse off. When a student under 16 is excluded, the principal and the Ministry of Education have some obligations to help the student find a new school. Even if the student is 16 or older and has been expelled, the Ministry has the power to direct another state school to accept the student. Withdrawing voluntarily may therefore you won&#x2019;t get any help from the principal or the Ministry. For more details, <a href="3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.html#Anchor-164">see &#x201C;What are my rights after I&#x2019;ve been excluded or expelled?&#x201D;, page 84</a>.</p><p class="Body">Note: Principals have to enter all stand-downs, suspensions and exclusions/expulsions into ENROL, the nationwide electronic enrolment management system. When a student is suspended, the principal must inform the Ministry of Education immediately, by submitting an &#x201C;Advice of Suspension&#x201D; form. After the board meeting has been held, its decision must be immediately communicated to the Ministry through an &#x201C;<span>Advice of BOT Decision</span>&#x201D; form. ENROL automatically checks that the process is completed before a student is withdrawn. If a school tries to remove a student from its roll without doing this, ENROL shows a warning message, stating: &#x201C;The Ministry has been advised this student was suspended by your school. Please submit the &#x2018;<span>Advice of BOT Decision</span>&#x2019; form before withdrawing the student.&#x201D;</p><h3 id=""><span><a id="Anchor-170">T</a></span>he board of trustees&#x2019; suspension meeting</h3><h4 id="">Who goes to the suspension meeting?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 17B</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he suspension meeting is an independent review of the principal&#x2019;s decision to suspend you. The principal doesn&#x2019;t have a role in the decision, but as a member of the board can attend the meeting.</p><p class="Body">You, the suspended student, can attend the meeting, along with your parents. You&#x2019;re allowed to take someone to support or represent you, such as a lawyer, a church elder, a kaum&#x101;tua, a youth worker, an advocate or a wh&#x101;nau member. A representative can support you and help you explain your side of things to the board.</p><p class="Body">For the board&#x2019;s meeting to be valid, at least half the trustees, not counting the principal, must be there. As most state school boards have seven or eight trustees, there must usually be four or five board members present. Integrated schools more commonly have 11 or 12 trustees, requiring at least six or seven members for a <span>valid meeting</span>.</p><h4 id=""><span><a id="Anchor-165"></a></span></h4><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: It&#x2019;s best that the student comes to the suspension meeting, as most boards like to meet the student and hear their side of the story. If the student can&#x2019;t make it to the meeting, the parents could read out a letter from the student to the board.</p><h4 id=""><span>W</span>ha<a id="Anchor-132">t you can do to prepare for the suspension meeting</a></h4><p class="Body">Before the meeting, you should plan what you&#x2019;re going to say and prepare any letters or other documents that will support your case:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Responding to questions</span> &#x2013; Prepare for any questions the board might ask (see below, &#x201C;What sorts of questions will the board ask?&#x201D;).</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Mitigating factors</span> &#x2013; At the meeting you should tell the board about any mitigating factors &#x2013; in other words, aspects of what happened that mean it&#x2019;s not as bad as it otherwise might have been, or things about your situation that make it appropriate for the board to respond less severely. For example, you may have immediately tried to put right the harm or damage you caused, or what happened may have been out of character for you. You should explore the reasons behind what happened, and provide evidence that might back up your explanation &#x2013; for example, medical or psychologists&#x2019; reports.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Witnesses</span> &#x2013; You should provide statements from anyone who witnessed what happened. If the board&#x2019;s chairperson agrees, witnesses will be able to come to the meeting and present their version of events in person. It&#x2019;s a good idea to give the board written copies of any witness statements before the meeting (and also other documents like character references and an apology); but if you haven&#x2019;t done this, bring copies to the meeting and give them to the board then.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Character references</span> &#x2013; Bring along any character references or testimonials that might help your case &#x2013; for example, from guidance counsellors, sports coaches or teacher aides.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Admitting the wrongdoing</span> &#x2013; At the meeting you should acknowledge that what you did was wrong. You should show the board that you have a strong desire to stay at the school and that you&#x2019;re willing to take practical, pro-active steps to prevent the same thing happening again. Bear in mind that board members are parents too, and they&#x2019;ll be concerned for their own children about safety and discipline at the school.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Apology</span> &#x2013; Write a letter of apology to the board, and also prepare a verbal apology to present to the board when it&#x2019;s your turn to speak at the meeting.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Conditions</span> &#x2013; Be ready to accept any reasonable conditions that the board might impose as part of its decision.<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: A student is far more likely to present a good case to the board if they genuinely want to return to school. Parents should therefore take the time to talk to their child and discuss whether they actually want to return to school &#x2013; and if not, why not. Parents should also be careful not to suggest anything to the board that the student won&#x2019;t be willing to agree to.</p></li>
			</ul><h4 id=""><span>W</span>hat&#x2019;s the process at the suspension meeting?</h4><p class="Body">There are no legal rules or regulations dealing with the procedure at suspension meetings. The format and process for the meeting will be decided by the board. Usually, however:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">the meeting will begin with the principal reading out their report for the board to consider</li>
				<li class="Bullet">then the student, the parents or their representative will tell their side and provide reasons why the student should be allowed to stay in school</li>

You and your parents will have been sent a copy of the principal&#x2019;s report before the meeting, and if you find any recommendations in it you should contact the principal and ask them to take out those recommendations. If, at the meeting, the principal makes a recommendation that&#x2019;s not in their report, you can raise this issue at the meeting and remind the board that it&#x2019;s their responsibility to review the principal&#x2019;s suspension decision and make their own decision.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="itals">Battison v Melloy</span> [2014] NZHC 1462</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he law requires the board to take all the relevant circumstances into account, to consider each of the options available to it, and to then make an independent decision.</p><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Regardless of the principal&#x2019;s view that a school rule has been broken, the board should consider whether you the student in fact effectively complied with the school.</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span> key principle of natural justice prevents the principal from taking part in the decision about whether to lift or extend a suspension, because they&#x2019;re the person who initiated the suspension. The principal is like the &#x201C;prosecutor&#x201D;, so they can&#x2019;t also be one of the judges. Although they&#x2019;re a member of the board, the principal shouldn&#x2019;t remain with the board when it&#x2019;s making its decision. The principal should leave the board meeting at the same time as you, your family and representatives.</p><p class="Body">If the board wants to call the principal back into the meeting to provide any other information, then you, your family and representatives should also called back in and be given a chance to question the principal.</p><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Any teacher, parent or other student who was directly involved in the incident that led to the suspension shouldn&#x2019;t be involved in any of the school&#x2019;s decision-making about the incident.</p><p class="Body">If the principal (or any board members) raise any new information or issues that you or your parents haven&#x2019;t heard about before, you can ask for the meeting to be adjourned (put off to a later date) so that you can consider the new information, and perhaps also get advice from a lawyer. If the meeting is adjourned, parents should get back to the board as soon as possible, as the board must make their decision within the seven-day (or 10-day) time limit.</p><h4 id=""><span>Telling your side of the story at the meeting</span></h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 13(c)</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span>fter the principal has read their report to the board, usually the next step in the meeting is that you, your parents or your representative tell your version of what happened. The right to tell your side of the story, after having had adequate time to prepare your case, is a key principle of &#x201C;natural justice&#x201D;. Natural justice is specifically mentioned in the part of the Education Act 1989 that deals with suspensions <span>and expulsions</span>.</p><p class="Body">The board will want to hear you admit that what you did was wrong and show them that you&#x2019;re willing to change. They&#x2019;ll want to hear you that you&#x2019;re keen to return to school, and you should give them reasons why you think you should be allowed to go back. It&#x2019;s a good idea to list some practical steps that you plan to take to prevent the incident happening again. For some detailed advice on putting your case at the meeting, <a href="3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.html#Anchor-165">see &#x201C;What you can do to prepare for the suspension meeting&#x201D;, page 77</a>.</p><p class="Body">If you don&#x2019;t agree with the principal&#x2019;s report and any other information the board is looking at, it&#x2019;s important that you and your family put forward your version of the facts and explain why you disagree. This can make a difference to the board in deciding whether you&#x2019;ll stay in school.</p><p class="Body">You may choose not to say anything about what happened. However, the board can still form a view about what happened and might draw conclusions from your silence &#x2013; for example, they might think that you agree with what the principal has said. If the board does draw conclusions, they should let you know and invite you to comment, without pressuring you to provide answers or explanations.</p><h4 id="">What sorts of questions will the board ask?</h4><p class="Body">When you tell your side of the story at the suspension meeting, the board of trustees is likely to ask the following types of questions (if you haven&#x2019;t already dealt with these issues):</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">Do you agree with what the principal has said?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Do you admit that what you did was wrong and not acceptable?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Are you sorry for what you did?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Can you explain your behaviour?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">What effects do you think your behaviour has had on others?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Why do you want to come back to school?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Why should the board allow you to come back to school?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">How would you change your behaviour if you were allowed to return to school?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">How can the board be confident that you will in fact change your behaviour?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Why should the board believe the things you have to say?</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">Before the meeting, parents should help make sure the student is well prepared to answer each of those questions. This doesn&#x2019;t mean giving the student the answers or putting words into their mouths &#x2013; it means getting them to think in advance about how they&#x2019;ll respond to questions. A good way to prepare is to role-play the suspension meeting, with the parents as the board of trustees.</p><h4 id="">When and how the board makes its decision</h4><p class="Body">After hearing from you, your parents or your representative, the board of trustees will usually ask you and your parents to leave the room so they can discuss the issues and make a decision. However, the board might decide to ask you all to stay so that everyone can try to reach agreement about what should happen.</p><h3 id="">The board&#x2019;s decision</h3><h4 id="">Key principles for the board&#x2019;s decision-making</h4><p class="Body">The board of trustees at a suspension meeting must:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">listen to both sides</li>
				<li class="Bullet">not follow an inflexible rule or policy &#x2013; the board has to consider your particular circumstances, weigh up all the factors, and consider all the options available to it, including the option of lifting the suspension subject to conditions</li>
				<li class="Bullet">take into account relevant factors only &#x2013; this means they must ignore any irrelevant information that was brought to the meeting</li>
				<li class="Bullet">make their decision in good faith, without any personal malice towards you or other improper motives</li>
				<li class="Bullet">approach their decision with open minds, without pre-conceived decisions &#x2013; However, the board <span class="semibold">won&#x2019;t</span> be guilty of pre-determining a case just because:</li>
				<li class="bullet-2">it puts importance on school traditions and setting high standards</li>
				<li class="bullet-2">it makes a quick decision, so long as the decision was made carefully</li>
				<li class="bullet-2">a school staff member told the student they would be suspended, so long as that other staff member isn&#x2019;t involved in the board&#x2019;s decision</li>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Lift the suspension with conditions</span> &#x2013; You go back to school full-time but have to comply with some ongoing conditions. For example, if you were suspended for bullying, conditions could include doing a behaviour management course and having counselling. Any conditions must be reasonable. For what happens if you don&#x2019;t comply with the conditions, see below: &#x201C;Rights and obligations during a suspension&#x201D;.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Extend the suspension with conditions</span> &#x2013; Here you aren&#x2019;t allowed to go back to school for a set time (unless the principal allows you to) and you must also meet some conditions. The length of the extended suspension can&#x2019;t be unreasonable. The conditions must also be reasonable and must be aimed at getting you back to school. Once the conditions are met or the extended suspension comes to an end (whichever happens first), you can return to school.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">&#x201C;Exclude&#x201D; you from the school (if under 16)</span> &#x2013; If you&#x2019;re excluded, the principal must try to arrange for you to be enrolled in another reasonably convenient school. If the principal hasn&#x2019;t been able to do this after 10 school days, they have to tell the Ministry of Education. For more details about exclusions, see <a href="3. Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.html#Anchor-166">page 84</a>.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="Headwords">Expel you (if 16 or older)</span> &#x2013; The principal and the Ministry don&#x2019;t have to help you find a new school if you&#x2019;ve been expelled.

In one court case where the board&#x2019;s decision was overturned, the judge found that the board&#x2019;s failure to consider the possibility of lifting a suspension, subject to conditions, meant that the school hadn&#x2019;t treated the student fairly.</p><p class="Body">At the board meeting, you and your parents should be prepared to put forward alternative measures for the board to consider as possible conditions &#x2013; for example:</p><ul>

In particular, principals have to take all reasonable steps to make sure that students get good guidance and counselling.</p><p class="Body">Remember that principals don&#x2019;t have the power to exclude or expel a student: only the board of trustees can do this, and only after following the proper process and hearing from the student and the parents: for more information <a href="3.

Instead, discipline in private schools is governed by each school&#x2019;s own rules and processes. However, parents and students can rely on an implied term of their enrolment agreement with the school that the school will behave fairly and reasonably.</p><h4 id="">What happens after I&#x2019;m suspended or expelled from a private school?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 35Q</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span>lthough suspension and expulsion decisions in private schools are governed by each school&#x2019;s own rules, the Education Act does specify what has to happen after the student is suspended or expelled.</p><p class="Body">First, the principal must immediately notify the Ministry of Education. If you&#x2019;re under 16 and you&#x2019;re not back at school or at a new school within a reasonable time, the Ministry has to make other arrangements for you. In these cases, the Ministry has to do one of the following things:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">arrange for you to be enrolled in another school</li>
				<li class="Bullet">direct a state school to enrol you, or</li>
				<li class="Bullet">direct your parents to enrol you in a correspondence school.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;re 16 or older, the Ministry doesn&#x2019;t have to do any of those things, but it can choose to do so.</p><p class="Body">Before it directs a state school to accept you in one of these cases, the Ministry has to consult with you, your parents and the new school&#x2019;s board. It can also consult with other people or organisations about your education or welfare if it thinks this is appropriate.<span class="itals char-style-override-8"></span></p></div>
