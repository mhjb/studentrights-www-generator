<h1>1. Accessing education</h1><h2 id="">Your right to education</h2><h4 id="">Who has a right to free state education in New Zealand?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 3</p><p class="Body"><span>E</span>veryone who is a New Zealand citizen or a permanent resident here has the right to free education at state schools from their fifth birthday until the end of the year in which they turn 19.</p><h4 id="">Can I go to any state school I want?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 11D, 146A</p><p class="Body"><span>N</span>o. Some schools have an &#x201C;enrolment scheme&#x201D;, which means you only have an automatic right to go there if you live in the school&#x2019;s home zone. If the school doesn&#x2019;t have an enrolment scheme, anyone can go there &#x2013; see below.</p><p class="Body">Also, girls don&#x2019;t have a right to go to boys-only schools, and boys don&#x2019;t have a right to go to girls-only schools. For more information on how this applies to transgender or gender non-conforming students, see below.</p><h4 id="">If I have a disability, does that affect my right to education?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 8</p><p class="Body"><span>N</span>o. If you have special educational needs, whether because of a disability or some other reason, you have the same rights to go to state schools as other students.</p><a href="1.

Students who live outside the zone can only go to the school if they&#x2019;re selected for a place under the rules of the scheme. Out-of-zone students are selected by balloting.</p><p class="Body">Schools can only adopt an enrolment scheme if this is necessary to avoid overcrowding. When there are more students who want to go to the school than there are spaces available, an enrolment scheme makes sure students are selected fairly and transparently, rather than having the school just choose whichever students it wants.</p><h4 id="">How is a school&#x2019;s home zone decided?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 11E</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he school defines its home zone on the basis that the school is a reasonably convenient one for students living in that area. The enrolment scheme has to define the zone precisely so that any particular address is either inside or outside the zone.</p><h4 id="">How are out-of-zone students selected?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 11F(1)</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f you live outside the home zone, then whether or not you&#x2019;ll be able to go to the school will depend on how many places the school has for out-of-zone students. To fill those out-of-zones places, the school has to follow an order of priority that&#x2019;s set nationally, by law:</p><ol>
				<li class="number">children who are accepted into special programmes run by the school (for example, special education or a M&#x101;ori language immersion class)</li>
				<li class="number">brothers and sisters of current students of the school</li>
				<li class="number">brothers and sisters of past students of the school</li>
				<li class="number">children of past students of the school</li>
				<li class="number">children of school staff or of the board of trustees</li>
				<li class="number">all other children who apply.</li>
			</ol><p class="Body">So if, for example, there are enough out-of-zone places to take all children from categories 1 to 3, but not enough for everyone in category 4, a ballot will decide which category 4 children will get to go to the school.</p><h4 id="">Who counts as a &#x201C;brother&#x201D; or &#x201C;sister&#x201D; for an enrolment scheme?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 11F(3)</p><p class="Body"><span>B</span>rothers and sisters (&#x201C;siblings&#x201D;) include:</p><ul>

			</ul><p class="Body">In particular cases the Ministry of Education can also instruct the school that particular children are to be treated as brothers or sisters.</p><h4 id="">What if, later, we move out of the home zone?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 11O, 11OA</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he school&#x2019;s board of trustees can cancel your enrolment if it believes on reasonable grounds that your parents used a temporary address to enrol you at the school. The school must send your parents a &#x201C;review notice&#x201D; first, giving them a chance to explain. If the board then decides to cancel your enrolment, you have one month to leave the school.</p><h2 id=""><span>Attendance requirements</span>: When you have to <span>be at school</span></h2><h4 id="">Between what ages do I have to go to school?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 20, 25</p><p class="Body"><span>Y</span>ou must be enrolled at and attend school from your sixth birthday until you turn 16.</p><p class="Body">However, a six-year-old doesn&#x2019;t have to go to school if they&#x2019;d have to walk more than three kilometres to the nearest school.</p><h4 id="">Exemptions from having to go to school</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 9, 20(2), 21, 22</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>here are some exceptions to the rule that all children between six and 16 have to go to school:</p><ul>

However, the Ministry of Health recommends that all children complete their immunisations on time, particularly before starting school. Diseases can spread very quickly in the classroom environment. Immunisation also protects other students and members of the community who are immunocompromised (this means that their body is unable to respond normally to infection due to a weakened immune system).</p><h4 id="">School Immunisation Register</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Health (Immunisation) Regulations 1995.</p><p class="Body"><span>B</span>efore or soon after enrolling, all primary schools must ask a student&#x2019;s parents for their immunisation certificate. Parents must provide the information. All primary schools must keep an immunisation register of all students, showing which diseases they have been immunised against and if they are fully immunised. If parents do not provide their child&#x2019;s immunisation certificate, the school must keep note of this.</p><p class="Body">The school must keep the immunisation register confidential. However, if a student has contracted a serious infectious disease, the local Medical Officer of Health can look at the register without parental consent and contact parents of unimmunised students to offer immunisation.</p><h4 id="">What happens if a student contracts a vaccine-preventable disease?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 19; Health (Infectious and Notifiable Diseases) Regulations 1966.</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he principal can make a student stay home to prevent the spread of disease (<a href="3.

Some may give you a punishment like writing lines or doing a detention.</p><p class="Body">If you wag school regularly, the principal could stand you down or suspend you, on the ground that this is continual disobedience that&#x2019;s a dangerous or harmful example to other students (<a href="3.

However, the school should investigate first and consider the reasons why you were absent and consider how the problem could be addressed.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education (School Attendance) Regulations 1951, reg 11</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f you&#x2019;re absent for 20 school days in a row and you don&#x2019;t tell the school that it&#x2019;s just a temporary absence, the principal can record you as having left the school. If you&#x2019;re under 16, you&#x2019;ll then have to either re-enrol at that school or enrol at another one.</p><h4 id="">What can happen to parents if their children are truant?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 20, 24, 25, 29</p><p class="Body"><span>P</span>arents have to enrol their children in school between the ages of six and 16. Each parent can be fined up to $3,000 each if they fail to do this.</p><p class="Body">As well as enrolling their children, parents also have to make sure their children go to school every day it&#x2019;s open, unless there&#x2019;s a genuine excuse, like being sick. If you don&#x2019;t make your children go to school, you could be charged and fined up to $30 for every day your child wags. If you&#x2019;re found guilty of this a first time, you could be fined up to a total of $300. If you&#x2019;re charged and found guilty again, you could have to pay up to $3,000.</p><h4 id="">How many hours a day do I have to be at school?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 25(3)</p><p class="Body"><span>O</span>n any given day you have to be at school for at least four hours, otherwise you&#x2019;ll be considered truant on that day. However, that doesn&#x2019;t mean you can leave school after four hours, as you&#x2019;ll still need to get the school&#x2019;s permission to leave before regular class hours are over. If you leave early without permission, you won&#x2019;t be officially marked as truant, but the school can discipline you.</p><p class="Body">A student with a disability might ask for permission to attend for the minimum four hours a day.</p><h4 id="">What are the school&#x2019;s responsibilities if a student is truant?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 25, 31; Education (School Attendance) Regulations 1951, reg 3</p><p class="Body"><span>B</span>oards of trustees have to take all reasonable steps to make sure the school&#x2019;s students are at school whenever it&#x2019;s open. Schools have to keep accurate daily attendance records for all students, and the school should also have a plan for managing non-attendance.</p><p class="Body">Steps the school could take to deal with a case of regular truancy could include:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">assessing the situation at a meeting of senior staff or the board of trustees</li>
				<li class="Bullet">making sure the family is told about the problem, both verbally and in writing, and in a way they can understand</li>
				<li class="Bullet">arranging a family meeting to discuss the problem</li>
				<li class="Bullet">contacting other agencies if there are issues such as learning difficulties, or abuse, neglect or other problems at home.</li>
			</ul><h4 id="">Attendance officers: Their role and powers</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 31</p><p class="Body"><span>S</span>chools can employ an &#x201C;attendance officer&#x201D; to make sure students go to school.</p><p class="Body">Attendance officers can detain students if they find them outside school, but they have to produce evidence of who they are, such as a badge. They can ask the student to provide their name and address, the name and address of their school, and the reason why they&#x2019;re absent. If the attendance officer isn&#x2019;t satisfied with the student&#x2019;s response, they can take the student home or to the school they think the student is enrolled at. However, an attendance officer can&#x2019;t go into the student&#x2019;s home uninvited.</p><p class="Body">A police officer has the same powers to deal with truant students as attendance officers.</p><h4 id="">When Child, Youth and Family and other agencies may get involved</h4><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;re regularly truant from school and the school has tried all options under its own attendance management plan, it can get the Ministry of Education&#x2019;s Attendance Service involved. One of the service&#x2019;s local organisations will then phone or visit your family to discuss your absence. They will work with you and your school to develop a plan to get you back into school.</p><p class="Body">In some cases your school or the police may also contact Child, Youth and Family on the basis that you may come under the care and protection laws.</p><p class="Body">If Child, Youth and Family become involved, they&#x2019;ll probably call a family group conference (FGC) to look at the issues of concern. At the conference, your parents and other family members can talk about why you&#x2019;re not going to school and can suggest solutions. The family group conference should develop a plan of action and Child, Youth and Family should make sure support is in place for you and your family.</p><h4 id="">I&#x2019;m concerned about my child wagging school &#x2013; what can I do?</h4><p class="Body">You could start by contacting one of the following people and telling them about your concerns:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">the school&#x2019;s attendance officer</li>
				<li class="Bullet">the school&#x2019;s guidance counsellor</li>
				<li class="Bullet">the dean for your child&#x2019;s year</li>
				<li class="Bullet">the principal</li>
				<li class="Bullet">the local Attendance Service organisation &#x2013; they&#x2019;ll help in finding your child and getting them back to school. You can contact the Attendance Service through your school or the Ministry of Education.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">You can also ask the school for an attendance report for your child.</p><h2 id=""><a id="Anchor-126">Different types of schools</a></h2><p class="Body">In New Zealand, there are three main types of schools:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">state schools, including not only ordinary state schools but also kura kaupapa M&#x101;ori, &#x201C;designated character&#x201D; schools and special schools</li>
				<li class="Bullet">integrated schools &#x2013; once private schools that are now part of the state school system but that still have a special character (Catholic schools for example)</li>
				<li class="Bullet">private schools.</li>
			</ul><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: The rights and obligations of students in state and integrated schools are mainly contained in the Education Act 1989. The Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975 deals with how integrated schools fit into the state system.</p><p class="Body"><span>P</span>rivate schools aren&#x2019;t covered by the same laws and regulations as state and integrated schools, and most of the information in this booklet doesn&#x2019;t apply to private schools. A student&#x2019;s rights at a private school are summarised below under &#x201C;Private schools&#x201D;.</p><h3 id="">State schools</h3><h4 id="">Types of state schools</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 2 (&#x201C;State school&#x201D; definition), 9, 155, 156</p><p class="Body"><span>S</span>tate schools<span class="Headwords"> </span>are the primary schools, intermediate schools, secondary schools and composite (primary/secondary) schools that are funded by the government and overseen by the Ministry of Education.</p><p class="Body">State schools also include:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">kura kaupapa M&#x101;ori</li>
				<li class="Bullet">&#x201C;designated character&#x201D; schools &#x2013; a designated character school could be, for example, an Islamic school</li>
				<li class="Bullet">special schools &#x2013; schools established for students with disabilities.</li>
			</ul><h3 id=""><a id="Anchor-148">Integrated (formerly private) schools</a></h3><h4 id="">What are &#x201C;integrated&#x201D; schools?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>ntegrated schools are schools that used to be private but that have now been &#x201C;integrated&#x201D; into the state system.</p><p class="Body">They receive the same amount of government funding as state schools and have to teach the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span>, but they&#x2019;re allowed to keep their &#x201C;special character&#x201D;, which is usually a connection to a particular religion or church. It can be a condition of enrolling at an integrated school that the student and parents agree to the school&#x2019;s special character.</p><p class="Body">Integrated schools can also charge a compulsory fee, called &#x201C;attendance dues&#x201D;. Integrated schools include, for example, Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Jewish, Islamic, Steiner and Montessori schools.</p><h3 id="">Private schools</h3><h4 id="">What are a student&#x2019;s rights at a private school?</h4><p class="Body">Enrolment at a private school is governed by a private contract (an agreement) between the school and the student&#x2019;s parents, rather than by the Education Act and the other laws and regulations that govern state and integrated schools. When they enrol, parents and students are making an agreement with the school: the parents will pay fees and the student will obey the school&#x2019;s rules, and in return the school will provide the student with an education.</p><p class="Body">If there&#x2019;s a dispute, including if the parents think the school has breached the contract, parents can use the court system. For small claims, parents can go to the Disputes Tribunal. It is a quicker, cheaper way of resolving disputes that sits outside of the formal court system. There are no lawyers or judges &#x2013; instead a referee makes a decision.</p><p class="Body">Although they&#x2019;re not covered by the Education Act, private schools must still follow all other New Zealand law. As well as standard contract law, this includes the Privacy Act 1993, the Human Rights Act 1993, and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.</p><h4 id="">What curriculum do they teach at private schools?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 35C, 35I(5), 35F</p><p class="Body"><span>P</span>rivate schools don&#x2019;t have to teach the same curriculum as state schools. They can develop their own curriculum and their own assessment standards, although these are reviewed regularly by the Education Review Office (ERO). The teaching standards must be at least as good as in state schools.</p><p class="Body">ERO reviews each private school every three years. The review makes sure that the school has suitable premises, staffing and equipment, that it has a suitable curriculum and that the teaching is of a standard at least as good as in state schools.</p><p class="Body">If it offers national qualifications like NCEA, the school will have to meet the standards set by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA).</p><h4 id="">Disciplinary processes at private schools</h4><p class="Body">If the student breaches the school rules, they&#x2019;ll be dealt with under the school&#x2019;s specific disciplinary processes. However, parents and students can also expect that the school will behave fairly and reasonably. Any disciplinary process must be legal. For example, a teacher can&#x2019;t smack a child, because that is against the law.</p><h3 id=""><a id="Anchor">Home-schooling</a></h3><h4 id="">What if I want to teach my child myself?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 21</p><p class="Body"><span>Y</span>ou do not have a <span class="itals">right </span>to home-school your child, but you can apply for a long-term exemption from enrolment. To do this, you&#x2019;ll need to satisfy the Secretary of Education that your child will be taught as regularly and as well as they would be at school.</p><p class="Body">You&#x2019;ll need to provide enough information to prove that you are meeting these requirements. For example, the Ministry will want to see weekly timetables or routines that show you can teach in a planned way. You don&#x2019;t need to teach the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span>, but you need a plan of what you&#x2019;ll teach and how you&#x2019;ll assess your child&#x2019;s learning.

The student must already by involved with more than one agency from the education or health sectors (including disability or mental health) or Child, Youth and Family.

The Alternative Education student remains on the school roll, while being taught in small groups in a different setting. The school oversees the programme and is responsible for the student.</p><p class="Body">There are advantages to working with students in the existing school environment. These include students having access to all school resources, and experiencing smoother transitions back into mainstream schooling, if this is in the student&#x2019;s best interests.</p><p class="Body">Activity Centres provide alternatives for students exhibiting &#x201C;at risk&#x201D; behaviour. They are places where students can have &#x201C;time out&#x201D; and then return to regular secondary schooling. They are also an alternative for those who aren&#x2019;t coping with a regular school.</p><h2 id="">School fees</h2><h4 id="">Can state schools charge fees?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 3</p><p class="Body"><span>N</span>o. Every New Zealand citizen or permanent resident is guaranteed free enrolment and free education from their fifth birthday until the end of the year in which they <span>turn 19</span>.</p><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Schools must clearly identify &#x2013; in their prospectus, website information and notices to parents &#x2013; that <span class="itals">all</span> charges for optional activities, including materials and services, are just that: optional. If a parent hasn&#x2019;t agreed to their child doing the activity, they can&#x2019;t be charged.</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he school can only charge for activities or services that are optional, and for items that students make at school but get to take home and keep. Schools can ask for voluntary donations, and parents can&#x2019;t be forced to pay these donations. This is explained in more detail below.</p><h4 id=""><span>D</span>o I have to pay the &#x201C;school donation&#x201D; / &#x201C;school fee&#x201D;?</h4><p class="Body">Most schools ask parents to pay a specific sum of money towards running the school and providing additional services for students. This is normally called a &#x201C;school donation&#x201D;, and is a way of parents contributing to the school by topping up government funding. Schools should make it clear to parents that this is a voluntary donation and that parents don&#x2019;t have to pay it. Unfortunately, some schools use the term &#x201C;fee&#x201D; or even &#x201C;levy&#x201D; to describe the voluntary donation, which implies that the parents have to pay it &#x2013; this is wrong.</p><p class="Body">Schools can suggest an amount for the annual donation, but they can&#x2019;t penalise parents (or the students) for choosing not to pay the suggested amount. In particular, schools can&#x2019;t insist that the donation be paid before they&#x2019;ll confirm the student&#x2019;s enrolment at the school.</p><p class="Body">The receipt the school gives you for your donation should state that it&#x2019;s a donation, and the donation will qualify for an income tax rebate. The school shouldn&#x2019;t include GST in any amount that qualifies as a donation, as schools don&#x2019;t have to pay GST on voluntary contributions from parents.</p><h4 id="">Can the school charge &#x201C;activity fees&#x201D; for course materials?</h4><p class="Body">Parents shouldn&#x2019;t be charged for the cost of teaching or materials used in delivering the school curriculum, unless there&#x2019;s a very clear take-home component. In subjects with a practical component, such as clothing and workshop technology, schools can charge for materials if the end-product belongs to the student and can, if paid for, be taken home.</p><p class="Body">At the start of the year, parents should be made aware that charges for materials are a feature of courses in practical subjects.</p><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;re uncertain or disagree about whether an activity is part of the school curriculum, you can contact the Ministry of Education about it.</p><h4 id="">Can the school charge &#x201C;activity fees&#x201D; for activities and events?</h4><p class="Body">Schools often ask parents to pay specific activity fees for events or activities like field trips, school camps, and music concerts.</p><p class="Body">If the event or activity isn&#x2019;t part of teaching the curriculum but rather is something that enhances it (for example, a trip to see a play), then it&#x2019;s legitimate for the school to exclude students who haven&#x2019;t paid the admission price or travel costs. However, the school can&#x2019;t send the student home during the activity, and must provide them with activities and supervision. This could involve placing the student in a different class while their class is on the trip. The school should also try to provide the student with an alternative experience or insight into the curriculum &#x2013; for example, a video.</p><p class="Body">If, however, a class field trip is an essential requirement for a subject (particularly at senior high school level), the school can&#x2019;t charge an activity fee for this, as it&#x2019;s part of the school curriculum and the school is funded by the government to deliver the curriculum.</p><p class="Body">It&#x2019;s reasonable for the school to ask parents to voluntarily pay a donation towards the travel costs associated with activities that are part of delivering the curriculum, like fieldwork in biology. But the school can&#x2019;t exclude any students whose parents can&#x2019;t or won&#x2019;t pay. The school should also make every effort to minimise the costs, by holding the activity as close to the school as possible.</p><p class="Body">It&#x2019;s also reasonable for schools to ask parents to voluntarily contribute towards the cost of a school camp or a fun trip (for example, a trip to the botanical gardens), which is part of the broader school programme. But again, the school can&#x2019;t require anyone to pay, and can&#x2019;t exclude students who don&#x2019;t pay.</p><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: If you can&#x2019;t afford an activity fee for take-home course materials or for optional activities, you should contact the school principal. In some cases, you may be able to negotiate an informal arrangement with the school, for example, a payment plan. You may also want to explore other avenues, such as an advance on your benefit from Work and Income.</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he school must tell parents in advance of any activity fees, and parents must be given the opportunity to agree to pay the charges. Schools may also ask for advance payment for optional activities during the year, but can&#x2019;t insist on this.</p><h4 id=""><span>C</span>an integrated schools charge fees?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975, s 36</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>ntegrated schools can charge a compulsory fee &#x2013; called an &#x201C;attendance due&#x201D; &#x2013; but this can&#x2019;t be more than the amount approved by the Minister of Education (which is published in the <span class="itals">New Zealand Gazette </span>&#x2013; go to <a href="http://www.gazette.govt.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.gazette.govt.nz</span></a>). These dues should also be clearly set out in any prospectus or enrolment information. Attendance dues can be used only to improve school buildings and facilities or to pay for debts or mortgages that the school has on the school&#x2019;s land or buildings. The school can&#x2019;t charge parents interest on unpaid dues.</p><h4 id="">Can we be refused a copy of the school magazine because we didn&#x2019;t pay the donation?</h4><p class="Body">Some items, including school magazines, may be funded entirely through donations and not through the Ministry of Education. Schools may therefore have a right to withhold these items.</p><h4 id="">Can the school refuse to issue a student ID card if we don&#x2019;t <span>pay the donation</span>?</h4><p class="Body">This depends. Some schools fund their student ID cards entirely from school donations, in which case they could refuse to issue a card if the donation isn&#x2019;t paid. However, the school should take into account that refusing to issue an ID card could have serious consequences for the student &#x2013; for example, not being able to use the school library or get a student pass for public transport. This could amount to unfair and illegal discrimination against the student.</p><p class="Body">It may be possible to work out a compromise &#x2013; for example, the parents might be able to pay for the cost of the ID card alone.</p><h4 id="">Can a school withhold a school report or leaving certificate because the family owes the school money?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">National Administration Guidelines (NAGs) 2, 2A</p><p class="Body"><span>S</span>chools are legally required to report on a student&#x2019;s progress and achievements to the student and to their parents. For students enrolled in years 1&#x2013;8, schools must also provide a written report on the student&#x2019;s progress and achievement in relation to the National Standards, at least twice a year. If a school tries to withhold school reports to &#x201C;encourage&#x201D; parents to pay the school donation or pay any money owed to the school, the school could be breaching its legal obligations.</p><p class="Body">However, school leaving certificates are different from school reports. These are basically administrative, rather than recording educational achievement, as they record things like whether the student has returned all borrowed school items, has any outstanding amount owed on their account, or has been taken off the school roll. The school can therefore refuse to release a student&#x2019;s leaving certificate if there is money owed on the child&#x2019;s account (for example, for stationery that the family have chosen to get from the school), but not for unpaid donations. </p><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Students and parents can also make specific requests under the privacy and information laws for all other information that the school holds about the student: <a href="5.

Parents can&#x2019;t be required to pay the school donation, as this is a voluntary contribution, even if the school describes it as the &#x201C;school fee&#x201D;.</p><p class="Body">However, it will be legitimate for the school to hire debt collectors to recover charges that you do in fact owe &#x2013; like the cost of lost or damaged library books, or charges for additional events or activities (like school camps) that the parents have agreed to pay.</p><p class="Body">If you disagree that you owe the debt, or with the specific amount that the school is claiming, it&#x2019;s important to write to both the debt collection agency and the school as soon as possible. If you can&#x2019;t come to an agreement, ask for help from YouthLaw or your nearest Community Law Centre (see <a href="http://www.youthlaw.co.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.youthlaw.co.nz</span></a>)</p><h2 id="">The New Zealand Curriculum</h2><h4 id="">Who decides what&#x2019;s taught in schools?</h4><p class="Body">There are three levels in the curriculum (the subjects studied at schools).</p><ol>
				<li class="number">The national curriculum (called <span class="itals">The New Zealand Curriculum</span>)</li>
				<li class="number">The school curriculum</li>
				<li class="number">The classroom curriculum</li>
			</ol><p class="Body">The <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span> sets the general framework for what is studied in all state and state-integrated schools. It sets out principles, values, key competencies and learning areas.</p><p class="Body">The board of trustees of every state and state-integrated school must develop and implement a curriculum that&#x2019;s based on the principles and values in the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span> and helps students develop the key competencies. However, schools have a lot of flexibility to decide how to shape their own curriculum to fit the needs of their own community.</p><p class="Body">In the classroom, teachers decide how to tailor the national and school curricula to their individual students.</p><p class="Body">For example, some of the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum </span>values are community and participation, ecological sustainability, integrity and respect. In line with these values and those of their community, a school might make the environment a focus of their curriculum. An individual class may then choose to study native plants and animals.</p><p class="Body">To give another example, one of the values in the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum </span>is &#x201C;excellence, by aiming high and persevering in the face of difficulties.&#x201D; Renwick School recognises this at the school level through a &#x201C;Give it a go kid&#x201D; award, and at the classroom level through &#x201C;personal best&#x201D; tables.</p><h4 id="">Are there compulsory subjects that my school must teach?</h4><p class="Body">Yes. The <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span> sets out seven learning areas that are compulsory for students in years 1 to 10:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">English</li>
				<li class="Bullet">The arts (dance, drama, music/sound arts, visual arts)</li>

			</ul><p class="Body">All schools with students in years 7 to 10 should also work towards offering their students the opportunity to learn second languages.</p><h4 id="">Does my school have to offer swimming?</h4><p class="Body">Yes. Swimming is part of the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span> and it is expected that all students will have had opportunities to learn basic aquatic skills by the end of year 6.</p><p class="Body">The Ministry of Education doesn&#x2019;t fully fund school pools, but they do provide operational funding which can be used either to run and maintain a school swimming pool or for travel and entry to a public swimming pool. Schools may also want to explore the possibility of using another local school&#x2019;s pool.</p><h4 id="">I think a teacher taught something inappropriate. What can I do?</h4><p class="Body">If a teacher taught material that you think was inappropriate for your child&#x2019;s age, it would be best to begin by talking to the teacher about your concerns. If you still have issues, you can than follow the school&#x2019;s general complaints procedure (<a href="7.

The principal can only release you if they&#x2019;re satisfied you have sincerely held religious or cultural views and that you&#x2019;ll be adequately supervised while you&#x2019;re out of class, either at school or outside. This right doesn&#x2019;t apply to integrated schools (<a href="1.

Schools are considered closed at lunchtime.</p><p class="Body">Schools can close for instruction for up to one hour per week for a maximum of 20 hours per year to allow religious instruction or observance.

It is important that your child&#x2019;s needs are assessed, so support can be provided and the most suitable programme can be developed.</p><p class="Body">An Individual Education Programme (IEP) is a programme for students with special education needs, which can be developed by you, your child, your child&#x2019;s teacher and specialists as appropriate. If you have an IEP, it should be reviewed at least twice a year, in a meeting with all those that developed it.</p><p class="Body">Schools are obliged to ensure the needs of all students are met, and a range of support is available to them. All schools receive a Special Education Grant (SEG) to help students with moderate behavioural and learning needs. Schools can also call on specially trained teachers, school-based resource teachers of learning and behaviour (RTLBs), who support and work within schools to assist staff and parents to meet the needs of students with moderate learning and/or behavioural difficulties. If your child has high social, behavioural or educational needs, you should talk to someone from Special Education at the Ministry of Education.</p><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">For more detailed information on the help available, see the Ministry of Education&#x2019;s resource, <span class="itals">Meeting Special Education Needs at School</span>, online at <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz"><span class="url url">www.minedu.govt.nz</span></a><span class="char-style-override-8"></span></p><p class="Body">&#xA0;</p><p class="Body">If problems arise, you should consider taking your issue to the principal and then the board of trustees.</p><h4 id="">Who qualifies for dedicated funding?</h4><p class="Body para-style-override-3">Students with special needs &#x2013; who may have a variety of physical, sensory, learning or behavioural difficulties &#x2013; are eligible for services and support through the Ministry of Education&#x2019;s schemes. Some of these services are:</p><h5 id="">Ongoing Resourcing Scheme (ORS)</h5><p class="Body">This is available for a very small group of children (about one per cent of the school population) with severe difficulties and high or very high education needs. The funding can be used for a wide range of specialist services and support, including:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">physiotherapists</li>
				<li class="Bullet">speech language therapists</li>
				<li class="Bullet">educational psychologists</li>
				<li class="Bullet">sign language interpreters</li>
				<li class="Bullet">additional teacher time</li>
				<li class="Bullet">teacher&#x2019;s aides</li>
				<li class="Bullet">visual or communication aids.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">Applications are usually made by school staff with the help of parents, and can be made at any time. Applications are assessed by verifiers (specialists from the Ministry of Education), who usually make their decision within three weeks.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 10.</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f an application for ORS funding is declined, you can appeal the decision. First, you can request that a different team of verifiers reviews the decision. Requests for review have to be made in writing within 6 months of the date the application was made. If your application has been reviewed and you&#x2019;re still unhappy, you can appeal to the Secretary of Education. Appeals are conducted by an arbitrator, who is like an independent referee. The Secretary of Education must comply with the arbitrator&#x2019;s decision.</p><h5 id="">School High Health Needs Fund</h5><p class="Body">This fund provides a teacher aide for students with significant health issues lasting more than 6 weeks. For example:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">students with seizures who need constant supervision</li>
				<li class="Bullet">students using oxygen bottles that need adult help to carry their equipment around school</li>
				<li class="Bullet">students with cancer who suffer severe tiredness, nausea and vomiting.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">The fund doesn&#x2019;t cover students who have high health needs resulting from an accident, as these are covered by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC).</p><h5 id="">Intensive Wraparound Service (IWS)</h5><p class="Body">The Intensive Wraparound Service is for students from years 3 to 10 with severe behavioural needs. It&#x2019;s available for students who are struggling to stay at school due to their highly challenging behaviour, and who need support at school, at home, and in the community.</p><p class="Body">Referrals usually must be made by a Resource Teacher Learning and Behaviour (RTLB) or someone from the Ministry of Education&#x2019;s Special Education team. If the student already has ORS funding (see above), their school can also make a referral.</p><p class="Body">If a referral is successful, a psychologist will work with the student, their family and wh&#x101;nau, the school and other agencies to develop a plan. Support is available for up to 3 years.</p><h5 id="">Interim Response Fund (IRF)</h5><p class="Body">This funding is available for urgent situations that require a short term response while a more long term plan is being implemented. It&#x2019;s usually used when a school has exhausted all its resources and is unable to manage &#x2013; for example, where a student&#x2019;s behaviour is likely to cause harm to others if it is not immediately addressed.</p><p class="Body">Schools request the funding from their local Ministry of Education office. Applications are made over the phone, and are processed quickly once approved.</p><p class="Body">Other specialists available through Special Education Offices include:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">speech language therapists</li>
				<li class="Bullet">special education advisers</li>
				<li class="Bullet">advisers on Deaf children</li>
				<li class="Bullet">occupational therapists</li>
				<li class="Bullet">physiotherapists</li>
				<li class="Bullet">registered psychologists</li>
				<li class="Bullet">kaitakawaenga</li>
				<li class="Bullet">early intervention teachers</li>
				<li class="Bullet">behaviour, communication and other education support workers.</li>
			</ul><h4 id="">Should a parent be told their child can only attend school for shorter periods because of funding shortfalls?</h4><p class="Body">No, this is not acceptable. It is a breach of section 8 of the Education Act (described in the introduction). Parents should enlist the services of staff from the Ministry of Education&#x2019;s special education area to ensure that their child is appropriately provided for. Parents may also contact the Office of the Children&#x2019;s Commissioner, which can help with information and advocacy.</p><h4 id="">Should parents be expected to top up teacher aide salaries?</h4><p class="Body">No. Parents are not required to contribute to staff salaries. A range of funding is available. School principals and boards of trustees should follow Ministry of Education policy and guidelines.</p><h4 id="">What happens when a student is suspended for behaviour that is a symptom of their disorder?</h4><p class="Body">Behavioural problems caused by recognised medical conditions wouldn&#x2019;t usually be considered deliberate, and so wouldn&#x2019;t amount to &#x201C;continual disobedience&#x201D;, because continual disobedience is when a student regularly and deliberately disobeys the school rules. There has to be deliberate non-cooperation or defiance.</p><p class="Body">Before suspending a student for being continually disobedient, the school should be able to show it has made every reasonable effort to find ways to address the student&#x2019;s behaviour.</p><p class="Body">Schools cannot:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">refuse to enrol a student because of disability&#xA0;</li>
				<li class="Bullet">give a student with a disability less favourable terms of admission than those provided for other students</li>
				<li class="Bullet">give a student with disabilities less benefits or services than those provided for other students</li>
				<li class="Bullet">suspend or expel a student because of disability.</li>
			</ul><h4 id="">Can a student be prevented from going on school camp due to their intellectual disability?</h4><p class="Body">No. The school camp is generally regarded as part of the school curriculum. It is unlawful to deny a student with disabilities the same benefits provided to other students, without reasonable justification.</p><p class="Body">Schools can access extra staff and funding for children with high or very high needs. Parents should argue that this extra funding could assist a child to go on camp.</p><p class="Body">A parent should consider these questions:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">What (in terms of extra assistance or resources) does my child need to go on camp?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">How can that be provided?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Is it reasonable to expect the school to provide this extra assistance?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Can I help to get this extra assistance (for example, can I offer to parent-help for some of the time)?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Who can help me to get extra assistance? (IHC, for example, provides services to people with intellectual disabilities and their families.)</li>

However, schools are only obliged to make reasonable attempts to accommodate students.</p><p class="Body">Schools don&#x2019;t have to provide special services or facilities when it&#x2019;s very difficult to do so. For instance, for a school camp the school wouldn&#x2019;t be expected to provide accessible toilet facilities for a student who uses a wheelchair. However, while the school wouldn&#x2019;t be expected to modify the toilet facilities, they could employ someone to assist the child with toileting.</p><p class="Body">Schools are also not obliged to include students if this would cause an unreasonable risk to the student or others. However, all students should be included so far as it is safe to do so.</p><p class="Body">Parents or caregivers should encourage discussion with the school to facilitate their child&#x2019;s education. If you feel your child is facing discrimination on the grounds of their special needs, you should discuss the matter with someone at the Human Rights Commission who will assist you to lay a complaint if necessary.</p><h4 id="">My child uses a wheelchair &#x2013; does the school need to be physically accessible?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">The Ministry Of Education Health And Safety Code Of Practice For State And State Integrated Schools, reg 3.</p><p class="Body"><span>Y</span>es. The school is responsible for making sure all students, including disabled students, can get around safely. They can get help from the property and special education teams at the Ministry of Education.</p><p class="Body">It is a good idea to tell the school about your child&#x2019;s needs before they start, to give the school time to make any changes.</p><h4 id="">Alternatives to mainstream schooling</h4><p class="Body">Sometimes, your child might need more support than can be provided at a mainstream school.
