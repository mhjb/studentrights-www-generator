<h1>4. Specific areas of control and discipline</h1><h2 id=""><a id="Anchor-156">Uniforms and appearance</a></h2><h4 id="">If<span class="Heading-4-Char char-style-override-11"> </span>my school has a uniform, do I have to wear it?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 72; New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 14</p><p class="Body"><span>M</span>ost New Zealand secondary schools, and some primary and intermediate schools, have rules requiring students to wear a school uniform. This comes under a school board&#x2019;s powers to make any rules it thinks are &#x201C;necessary or desirable for the control and management of the school&#x201D;.</p><p class="Body">Technically, a school uniform rule won&#x2019;t be legally enforceable if it breaches students&#x2019; rights of freedom of expression under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. However, the New Zealand courts would probably see most school uniform codes as being a reasonable and allowable restriction on a student&#x2019;s right to freedom of expression.</p><h4 id="">Can I be punished for not wearing the uniform?</h4><p class="Body">This would depend on the particular case.</p><p class="Body">You shouldn&#x2019;t be punished if your parents or caregivers can&#x2019;t afford to buy a uniform. Parents should talk to the school, which may have second-hand uniforms that can be bought cheaply. Parents who are on a low income or benefit may be able to get financial help from Work and Income.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14</p><p class="Body"><span>H</span>owever, if you simply refuse to wear a uniform, the school could:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">give you a warning</li>
				<li class="Bullet">give you a detention or extra duties</li>
				<li class="Bullet">stand you down or suspend you for continual disobedience, if you&#x2019;ve already had a number of warnings.</li>
			</ul><h4 id="">Can I be sent home for not wearing the correct uniform?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14; Education (Stand-Down, Suspension, Exclusion, and Expulsion) Rules 1999, rule 8</p><p class="Body"><span>Y</span>ou can only be sent home if you&#x2019;ve been formally stood down or suspended.</p><h4 id="">Can students wear items of cultural or religious significance?</h4><p class="Body">Yes. It&#x2019;s illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, gender, or national or ethnic origin, and so, for example, the Human Rights Commission has upheld the right of M&#x101;ori students to wear taonga at school, despite uniform codes that ban jewellery.</p><p class="Body">Schools can ask, however, that students provide a genuine reason for wanting to wear items of cultural and religious significance.</p><h4 id="">Are<a id="Anchor-137"> schools allowed to have different uniforms for males and females?</a></h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, <span>s 19</span> (state schools); Human Rights Act 1993, s 21 (private schools)</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span>lthough it&#x2019;s illegal for schools to treat students differently on the basis of gender, this probably doesn&#x2019;t prevent different school uniform codes for male and female students.</p><p class="Body">In one case (from 1991) the Human Rights Commission agreed with a complaint by two female-identified students who claimed that the school requirement to wear a skirt disadvantaged them because it restricted their activities and therefore it amounted to discrimination on gender grounds. This particular case was settled by the school agreeing to change its uniform so t<a id="x.175491">hat female students could choose to wear &#x201C;culottes&#x201D; (shorts that look like skirts). This case shows that the current law is probably that schools can have different uniforms for male and females, but that the particular uniforms can&#x2019;t disadvantage one gender or any other particular group.</a></p><h4 id="">Can transgender students choose which uniform they wear?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Human Rights Commission, Supporting Trans Students, <span class="url url">www.hrc.co.nz</span><span class="char-style-override-8"></span></p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he Human Rights Commission has said that transgender students should be able to wear the uniform that matches their gender identity.

In the 1970s, the Court of Appeal upheld a school&#x2019;s right to enforce rules about hair. However that decision is now more than 40 years old, and it was made before the Bill of Rights was passed, protecting the right of freedom of expression.</p><p class="Body">In a 2014 High Court decision (<span class="itals">Battison v Melloy</span>), the judge found that the particular hair rule in this case wasn&#x2019;t legally enforceable because it wasn&#x2019;t certain enough. In this case, the school board had agreed with the principal&#x2019;s decision that the hair rule had been broken. However, the judge disagreed with the board&#x2019;s decision because the board hadn&#x2019;t independently considered whether the student&#x2019;s offer to wear his hair in a bun amounted to effective compliance with the rule (which didn&#x2019;t specifically say that a student&#x2019;s hair had to be cut short).</p><p class="Body">The judge in <span class="itals">Battison v Melloy</span> said that schools should carefully consider whether a proposed hair rule would breach students&#x2019; rights to autonomy and individual dignity, and their right to freedom of expression under the Bill of Rights. The judge said that it would be unlawful to make a rule which gave the principal complete discretion to decide whether a student&#x2019;s dress and appearance was acceptable.</p><p class="Body">There will also be exceptions for students who can show that they have a genuine reason for keeping their hair long. For example, hair length has religious significance for Sikhs and cultural significance for Rastafarians. A student&#x2019;s personal preference would not suffice as an acceptable reason.</p><h4 id="">Challenging a rule about uniform or appearance</h4><p class="Body">While schools have the right to make rules, students and parents who are unhappy about a particular rule should ask the school why the rule exists &#x2013; is it, for example, for safety reasons? You should think about these questions:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">How important is this issue to you? Is it important enough to risk disrupting your education?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Why is the issue important? For example, are religious or cultural values involved?</li>
				<li class="Bullet">What are the possible consequences of continuing to challenge the rule?</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">Sometimes schools and families can become hardened in positions they&#x2019;ve taken about an issue. There are sometimes no easy answers. If you&#x2019;ve carefully thought about the issue and want to pursue it further, you can contact one of the agencies listed at the back of this booklet (<a href="7. Fixing problems and making complaints.html#Anchor-154">see &#x201C;Useful contacts&#x201D;, page 139</a>).</p><h2 id="">Searching students and confiscating items</h2><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 139AAA-139AAI; Education (Surrender, Retention, and Search) Rules 2013; Ministry of Education&#x2019;s &#x201C;Guidelines for the Surrender and Retention of Property and Searches&#x201D;</p><p class="Body"><span>D</span>etailed laws were introduced in 2014 giving teachers in state and integrated schools limited powers to search students&#x2019; clothing and bags in some situations and to confiscate items from them. However, the students themselves can&#x2019;t be searched, and neither can their clothing while they&#x2019;re still wearing it.</p><h4 id="">Teacher&#x2019;s power to order student to hand over an item</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 139AAA, 139AAD, 139AAF</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span> teacher can require you to hand over an item if they believe on reasonable grounds that it&#x2019;s something likely to endanger anyone&#x2019;s safety or to have a negative or disruptive effect on the school&#x2019;s learning environment. The teacher can only do this if you have the item in clear view or if they have reasonable grounds to think you&#x2019;re hiding it in your pockets or somewhere else about you, or in a bag or container.</p><p class="Body">The teacher can&#x2019;t search you directly for the item or use any physical force.</p><p class="Body">If you refuse to hand over the item, the school can take reasonable disciplinary steps against you.</p><h4 id="">Teacher&#x2019;s power to search clothing and bags for harmful items</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, <span>ss 139AAB, 139AAD</span></p><p class="Body"><span>S</span>chools have limited powers to search your clothing and bags, but only if they think you have something harmful. An item is considered &#x201C;harmful&#x201D; if it poses an immediate threat to anyone&#x2019;s safety, including their emotional safety.</p><p class="Body">If a teacher believes on reasonable grounds that you have something harmful and you&#x2019;ve refused to hand it over, the teacher can require you to:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">take off any outer clothing you&#x2019;re wearing (including a coat, jacket, jumper or cardigan)</li>
				<li class="Bullet">take off your shoes and socks (but not tights or stockings)</li>
				<li class="Bullet">hand over the bag or other container.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">The teacher can then search the clothing, footwear, bag or container. The teacher <span class="semibold">can&#x2019;t</span> search any clothing while you&#x2019;re still wearing it.</p><p class="Body">Whether or not the teacher finds anything, they have to immediately return your clothing, footwear, bag or container to you.</p><h4 id="">What<span class="Heading-4-Char char-style-override-11"> </span>does &#x201C;reasonable grounds&#x201D; mean?</h4><p class="Body">The teacher doesn&#x2019;t need to be absolutely certain you have the item in order to have a &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; belief. What&#x2019;s reasonable will depend on the context, and also on the type of item the teacher thinks you have. Reasonable grounds can be based, for example, on information from other students. But it wouldn&#x2019;t be reasonable for the teacher to make assumptions based on what you&#x2019;ve done in the past. That means even if they have found a harmful item on you before, they must not use this as grounds for searching your clothes or belongings if they have no other evidence.</p><h4 id="">My school has a policy that students and their property can be searched by school staff &#x2013; is this legal?</h4><p class="Body">No. The school can only carry out searches as allowed by the search and confiscation powers explained in this section. Students also can&#x2019;t be asked to consent to something that&#x2019;s outside those powers.</p><p class="Body">The school may argue that by being enrolled at the school, you and your parents have agreed to this policy, but this is incorrect, as schools can&#x2019;t adopt policies that breach New Zealand law.</p><p class="Body">However, if you freely volunteer to empty your bag (for example, because you&#x2019;re keen to prove you&#x2019;re innocent), then that is fine.</p><h4 id="">Can the school strip-search me?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 139AAD, 139AAF</p><p class="Body"><span>N</span>o. However, if you refuse to remove your outer clothing when asked, or refuse to hand over a bag or container, the school can take reasonable disciplinary steps against you.</p><h4 id="">Can schools do blanket searches of whole classes or groups of students?</h4><p class="Body">No. If, for example, something has apparently been stolen, the school can&#x2019;t do a blanket search, even for a harmful item. For a teacher to be able to use the power to search students&#x2019; outer clothing or bags for harmful items, the teacher must have a reasonable belief relating to <span class="semibold">each</span> student.</p><p class="Body">If a stolen item isn&#x2019;t harmful &#x2013; a pair of shoes, for example &#x2013; and the teacher has a reasonable suspicion that a particular student has it, the teacher can demand that the student return the item. If the student doesn&#x2019;t return it, they can be disciplined.</p><p class="Body">The police can be called if the school thinks this is appropriate.</p><h4 id="">Can a school search my locker?</h4><p class="Body">A school can search its own property at any time for any reason. This includes lockers and desks provided to students for storage, like lockers and desks. If you freely choose to use a school-provided storage area, the school will be free to search it. The terms and conditions about the use of lockers should state that the school can search your locker and any bag or container in it.</p><p class="Body">This doesn&#x2019;t mean that a school can search your bag whenever you leave it somewhere. If you&#x2019;ve only left your bag somewhere temporarily &#x2013; for example, on a hook in the changing room during a single PE class &#x2013; you probably haven&#x2019;t given up control of it. This means your bag could only be searched if a teacher reasonably believed it contained a harmful item.</p><p class="Body">If you don&#x2019;t want your school to be able to search your bag at any time, it is best not to leave it in a school-provided storage area.</p><h4 id="">If teachers think a student has something illegal, can they hold them until the police arrive?</h4><p class="Body">The school can keep you under supervision until the police arrive. If you leave, the school can discipline you. If you leave the school grounds, you&#x2019;ll be considered truant.</p><p class="Body">The laws on searches and confiscations in schools don&#x2019;t affect the powers that the police have. The police can carry out searches if these are lawful and reasonable, and this will depend on the circumstances in each case. For example, if police have reasonable grounds to believe drugs are involved, they can search you without your consent. The police, like the school, can&#x2019;t carry out &#x201C;blanket searches&#x201D; of whole groups or classes of students &#x2013; to carry out a search of any student or their property, the police have to have reasonable grounds that relate specifically to that student.</p><p class="Body">If the police want to search you, you should say clearly that you don&#x2019;t consent to the search, but it is best not to resist. If you think the search was carried out roughly or without good reason, you should complain to the Independent Police Conduct Authority &#x2013; <a href="http://www.ipca.govt.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.ipca.govt.nz</span></a><span class="semibold"></span></p><h4 id="">Can the school call in drug-sniffing dogs to do a general search <span>for drugs?</span></h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 139AAE</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span> school can search its own property at any time, for any reason, and by any method. This includes lockers, desks and other storage containers provided to students. The school can hire contractors to bring in drug-sniffing dogs to search desks, lockers and other school property. However, the students themselves can&#x2019;t be searched.</p><p class="Body">The police can use drug-sniffing dogs to search a person if the police have a reasonable suspicion, or if they have a search warrant issued by a court.</p><h4 id="">Can a school carry out drug-testing of students?</h4><p class="Body">Random drug testing of students isn&#x2019;t allowed.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 15, 17</p><p class="Body"><span>H</span>owever, if you&#x2019;ve been suspended, the board of trustees can place reasonable conditions on you coming back to school. These can include requiring you to participate in a drug treatment programme that includes testing for drugs.</p><p class="Body">Students can also freely agree to be tested for drugs.</p><h2 id="">Investigating criminal behaviour by students</h2><h3 id="">For students</h3><h4 id="">What rights do I have when being questioned by the police?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 23.</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span>nyone being questioned by the police has the right:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">to remain silent</li>
				<li class="Bullet">to a lawyer</li>
				<li class="Bullet">to be told what their rights are.</li>
			</ul><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989</p><p class="Body"><span>C</span>hildren and young people (under 17) also have extra rights:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">A child (10 to 13 years old) or young person (14 to 16 years old) who wants to make a statement to the police has the right to a &#x201C;nominated adult&#x201D;. This means you can pick an adult <span class="itals">of your choice</span> as a support person. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be your parent or caregiver.</li>
				<li class="Bullet">You must be informed of your right to talk to a lawyer, in a way which you can understand. You&#x2019;re allowed to speak with a lawyer <span class="itals">and</span> the adult you choose.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">The same rights apply whether the police are questioning you at school or out of school.</p><h4 id="">Who<span class="Heading-4-Char char-style-override-11"> </span>can I choose as my &#x201C;nominated adult&#x201D;?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s 222.</p><p class="Body"><span>Y</span>ou can choose any adult to support you if you&#x2019;re being interviewed by the police. It could be, for example:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">Your parent or guardian</li>
				<li class="Bullet">An adult family/wh&#x101;nau member</li>
				<li class="Bullet">A teacher (it&#x2019;s best if it isn&#x2019;t the staff member involved in the incident)</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Any other adult of your choosing.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">If you don&#x2019;t nominate someone, the police can choose an adult for you. It can&#x2019;t be a police officer.</p><h4 id="">What if I choose someone that the police officer thinks is unsuitable?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s 222.</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span>ny adult you nominate must be allowed to support you, unless:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">The police believe the adult may try to interfere with the investigation (for example, by helping you lie to the police)</li>
				<li class="Bullet">They can&#x2019;t be found or won&#x2019;t be available within a reasonable amount of time.</li>
			</ul><h4 id="">What are my rights when school staff interview me about a crime?</h4><p class="Body">Your rights in this situation aren&#x2019;t covered by legislation, as they are when being interviewed by police. Generally, a school&#x2019;s duties are about education and safety at school. The school shouldn&#x2019;t question you about things that happen outside of school, unless they directly affect the school or your education.</p><p class="Body">If school staff have a reason to interview you about criminal activity happening at school, you have the following rights:</p><p class="Body"><span class="itals">Principles of natural justice</span></p><p class="Body">The school should:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">Act in good faith, without bias. This means they should be fair.</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Give you a chance to tell your side of the story</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Tell you what they&#x2019;re accusing you of and give you time to get a defence ready.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body"><span class="itals">United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child, article 40</span></p><p class="Body">You have the right:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">To be presumed innocent until proven guilty</li>
				<li class="Bullet">To be told what you&#x2019;re accused of</li>
				<li class="Bullet">To have your parents or guardians with you</li>
				<li class="Bullet">To have legal or other appropriate help</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Not to made to give a statement or confess guilt</li>
				<li class="Bullet">To have your privacy fully respected at all stages of the interview.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">This means that before questioning you, your school should:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">Tell you what you are being questioned about or accused of</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Ask you if you would like to have your parent, guardian, or another adult to with you. If you don&#x2019;t want your parent there, you could ask for the guidance counsellor or another teacher.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">If you feel a teacher or principal was overbearing or forced you into anything, you should tell another adult. This might mean the interview was unfair, and the information they got might not be able to be used against you.</p><h4 id="">Can I be made to sign a statement or confession?</h4><p class="Body">No. You can&#x2019;t be made to sign a statement, and if the school asks you to, you should think about it carefully.</p><p class="Body">Sometimes the school might ask you to sign a statement confessing or accusing another student of an offence. Questioning students shouldn&#x2019;t involve written statements or confessions. But if the school does ask you to sign something, you should talk to your parents or another adult and consider:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">The purpose of the document and why you&#x2019;re being asked to sign it</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Whether the document is going to be used in evidence.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">It&#x2019;s unlikely that a statement could be used as evidence in court, unless all the legal safeguards had been followed.</p><p class="Body">If the school plans to use the statement for another purpose (like a board of trustees disciplinary meeting) the principles of natural justice and UN Convention on the Rights of the Child must be followed (see above).</p><p class="Body">Any staff member that asks you to sign a statement should:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">Explain that you don&#x2019;t have to sign</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Explain where and how the statement might be used</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Suggest that you get legal advice before signing.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">You should never be forced to sign something by threats of what will happen if <span>you don&#x2019;t</span>.</p><p class="Body">You and your parents should feel free to discuss any concerns with the staff involved, the principal and the police.</p><h3 id="">For parents and caregivers</h3><h4 id="">I have been chosen as a &#x201C;nominated adult&#x201D; &#x2013; what is my role?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s 222.</p><p class="Body"><span>Y</span>our role is to:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">Do your best to make sure the child or young person understands what the police officer tells them, including their rights</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Support the child or young person before and during questioning</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Support them during a statement, if they agree to make one.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">You aren&#x2019;t just there to observe, but to help and advise the child or young person. You should meet with them privately before the police interview starts, to:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">Gain their confidence</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Understand how they communicate</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Make sure they understand their rights and what is going to happen during the interview</li>
				<li class="Bullet">Learn what they want to say during the interview.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">It&#x2019;s a good idea to encourage the young person to get some legal advice as soon as possible, and to make sure they get it. It&#x2019;s unlikely that they will know a lawyer, so they should be given the names of some lawyers who they could talk to over the phone or in person. The questioning police officer should be able to give you a list.</p><p class="Body">During the police interview, you should provide support. You should make sure the young person understands the questions, can answer them as they want to, and is understood properly. Your role is to make sure they are not disadvantaged.</p><h4 id="">Does<span class="Heading-4-Char char-style-override-11"> </span>the school need to let me know that my child is being questioned by the police at school?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 77(b).</p><p class="Body"><span>T</span>he law is unclear on this. However, it is important to remember that schools must inform parents of matters which, in the principal&#x2019;s opinion, are affecting students&#x2019; progress or harming their relationship with other students.</p><p class="Body">Note: the law is clear when questioning occurs at a police station. The police must let parents or guardians know when a young person is being questioned at a police station, even if the young person nominates someone else as a support person. You have the right to visit them and talk to them privately.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s 229.</p><h4 id=""><span>W</span>hat if my child says, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want my parents to be contacted&#x201D;?</h4><p class="Body">If the student is at a police station and under 17 years old, the police must inform their parents or guardians. If the student is 17 or over, the police do not have to do this.</p><p class="Body">At school, whether parents are contacted will be up to the school policy, however, it is the school&#x2019;s duty to inform parents of matters which, in the principal&#x2019;s opinion, are affecting students&#x2019; progress or harming their relationship with other students.</p><h4 id="">What is the school&#x2019;s role if the police are questioning my child at school?</h4><p class="Body">The school&#x2019;s role is not clearly defined by legislation. If a teacher attends the interview as a young person&#x2019;s &#x201C;nominated adult&#x201D; supporter, they have the duties set out above. If the teacher is not the student&#x2019;s nominated adult, the teacher has no automatic right to be there. They can be there only if police and the student both consent.</p><p class="Body">For young people, the consequences of admitting guilt, or getting a conviction, can be very serious. Schools should stress the student&#x2019;s right to consult a lawyer, and help them to take advantage of this right. Teachers should also be aware of the young person&#x2019;s right to silence, and make sure that the student is not pressured to respond.</p><h4 id="">What policy should schools have about police questioning at school?</h4><p class="Body">If the school has a policy, it should cover:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">contacting parents or guardians when a student is under 17</li>
				<li class="Bullet">contacting parents or guardians when a student is 17 or over</li>

It includes not just physical attacks but also verbal bullying and other emotional attacks, such as gossip, name-calling, humiliating or shaming people, and excluding people from groups and games.</p><p class="Body">There are a range of legal and other protections against bullying, and these apply not just to things that students do but also to teachers&#x2019; behaviour</p><p class="Body">With the arrival of texting and social networking websites, bullying in schools has become more sophisticated and more difficult to control &#x2013; for example, bullies can create false online profiles or post abusive comments or embarrassing pictures or videos. Although &#x201C;cyberbullying&#x201D; of this type might start outside school, the flow-on effects can lead to serious problems within the school.</p><h3 id="">Schools&#x2019; responsibilities to protect against bullying</h3><h4 id="">What are the school&#x2019;s obligations to protect against bullying?</h4><p class="Body">Schools have various legal and ethical responsibilities to try to stop bullying and to deal with it effectively when it happens:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss&#xA0;60A, 61, 63; National Administration Guidelines, NAG 2(b), 5, <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz"><span class="url url">www.minedu.govt.nz</span></a><span class="char-style-override-8"></span></p><span class="Headwords">E</span><span class="Headwords">ducation policy and guidelines</span><span class="itals"> &#x2013; </span>School boards are required by government education guidelines to &#x201C;provide a safe physical and emotional environment for students&#x201D;. Schools should have an anti-bullying policy and other policies to achieve a safe environment, and should regularly review these policies.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, <span>ss 37 and 45</span></p><span class="Headwords">H</span><span class="Headwords">ealth and safety laws</span><span class="itals"> &#x2013; </span>Schools have to take every possible step to make sure no physical or mental harm happens to students, teachers and others at school as a result of any &#x201C;hazard&#x201D; &#x2013; which includes people&#x2019;s behaviour. This could also include, for example, the long-term systematic bullying that some children with disabilities may experience. A school that allows bullying to occur &#x2013; for example by teachers failing to take action against it &#x2013; could face prosecution under the health and safety laws. These health and safety requirements apply not just to school boards of trustees but also to governing committees of school boarding hostels.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Accident Compensation Act 2001, <span>s 317</span></p><span class="Headwords">D</span><span class="Headwords">uty of care under civil law</span><span class="itals"> &#x2013; </span>Schools also owe a &#x201C;duty of care&#x201D; to their students under the civil law of negligence. This means that they have to ensure the safety and well-being of students. A student who suffers harm through being bullied may be able to bring a claim in the courts for a breach of this duty of care. However, in particular cases this right may be barred by the ACC laws. Physical injuries, and psychological harm related to physical injuries, are likely to be covered by ACC, and that means you can&#x2019;t bring civil claims in the courts for them. A lawyer will be able to help you understand what options may be available in your case. Call into your local Community Law Centre for free legal advice.</li>

You may be able to use this code as a basis for challenging a teacher&#x2019;s bullying behaviour.</li>
			</ul><h3 id="">Complaining to your school about bullying</h3><h4 id="">Reporting the bullying to the school</h4><p class="Body">If you are concerned that you or your child is being bullied at school, you should start by talking to the student&#x2019;s teacher or the principal.</p><p class="Body">Find out if the school has a specific anti-bullying policy, and processes for dealing with it. This policy may say who reports of bullying should be made to. You could also ask if the school has a &#x201C;confidential disclosure system&#x201D; so that both victims and bullies can talk safely about the bullying.</p><p class="Body">If the school doesn&#x2019;t have a specific anti-bullying policy you could emphasise to the school that it has a legal duty to provide a safe environment for students, and encourage them to develop a policy.</p><p class="Body">If the school does have an anti-bullying policy but it doesn&#x2019;t seem to be working in practice, you could ask that you meet with the principal and the chairperson of the board of trustees to discuss how to address this.</p><h4 id="">How the school should respond</h4><p class="Body">The Children&#x2019;s Commissioner has made suggestions about how schools should respond to reports of bullying. In summary, students and their parents should expect that the school will:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">hear and respond to them with sensitivity</li>
				<li class="Bullet">respond appropriately to the problem</li>
				<li class="Bullet">give them feedback</li>
				<li class="Bullet">protect them from any negative consequences resulting from reporting the bullying</li>
				<li class="Bullet">support victims of bullying at the school.</li>
			</ul><h4 id="">What if we&#x2019;re not happy with the school&#x2019;s response?</h4><p class="Body">If a student and their parents aren&#x2019;t happy about the way the school has dealt with a complaint of bullying, they can make a written complaint to the board of trustees. Parents can ask to be at the meeting where their complaint will be discussed. To get to speak at the meeting, parents will need permission from the chairperson. It may help to take along a support person who&#x2019;s used to dealing with these sorts of complaints (see the support agencies listed at the end of this chapter.)</p><p class="Body">If parents are unhappy with the way the board of trustees deals with their complaint, they can complain to the Education Review Office, the Ministry of Education or the Children&#x2019;s Commissioner (see Useful Contacts).</p><h3 id="">Complaining to the police under the criminal law</h3><h4 id="">Can I lodge a complaint with the police?</h4><p class="Body">In some cases, yes. The section below explains when bullying can amount to a criminal offence.</p><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, ss 14(1)(e), 18, 272(3)</p><p class="Body"><span>I</span>f the police decide the criminal law has been broken, and the student doing the bullying is under 14 years old, the student could be asked to attend a family group conference with their family. Young people aged 14, 15 or 16 can be charged and dealt with in the Youth Court, while those who have turned 17 could face a criminal charge in the District Court (the adult courts). In deciding whether to take action on a complaint, the police will consider all the circumstances, including how serious the behaviour was.</p><p class="Body">Whether or not you complain to the police, you should report all forms of bullying to the school.</p><h4 id="">Can bullying be a criminal offence?</h4><p class="Body">It might be, depending on how serious and damaging the bullying is, and depending also on the context and the type of bullying:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Crimes Act 1961, ss 196, 306; <span>Summary Offences</span> Act 1981, s 9</p><span class="Headwords">A</span><span class="Headwords">ssaults and threats</span> &#x2013; It&#x2019;s a criminal assault not only if someone physically assaults you, but also if they threaten to do this and you have a reasonable belief that they can carry out the threat. This would include not just threats made face-to-face but also by, for example, a text message. There&#x2019;s also a separate criminal offence of threatening to kill or injure someone.</li>

If the harasser doesn&#x2019;t realise you feel distressed or harassed, their behaviour could still be &#x201C;civil harassment&#x201D;, which means you can apply to the Family Court for a restraining order to stop the harassment; but you can do this only if the harasser is 17 or older.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Telecommunications Act 2001, s 112</p><span class="Headwords">M</span><span class="Headwords">isusing a phone</span> &#x2013; It&#x2019;s a criminal offence for someone to intentionally use a phone to disturb, annoy or irritate you, or to send you a fake instruction or message. It&#x2019;s also an offence to use &#x201C;profane, indecent, or obscene&#x201D; language over a phone, or to suggest something to you that&#x2019;s profane, indecent or obscene, if they do this with the intention of offending you.</li>
			</ul><h4 id="">Cyberbullying &#x2013; what you can do about bullying through texts and social media</h4><p class="Body">&#x201C;Cyberbullying&#x201D; means using a mobile phone, the internet or other technology (like a digital camera) to bully another person, by causing them hurt or embarrassment.</p><p class="Body">For most social networking sites like Facebook, and all New Zealand mobile phone providers, bullying is a breach of the terms of use. If you&#x2019;ve been cyberbullied, you can complain to the bully&#x2019;s mobile phone provider or the social networking site. A warning to the bully from the provider that they could be banned from using their phone or the site is likely to be a powerful deterrent to them.</p><p class="Body">The website <a href="http://www.netsafe.org.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.netsafe.org.nz</span></a> has information on how to report abuse to social networking sites providers.</p><p class="Body">If the cyberbullying involves physical threats, and you&#x2019;re concerned about your safety, contact the police.</p><p class="Body">If you&#x2019;ve been cyberbullied, you should make sure you save all the bullying messages and pictures. Text messages can be saved on a mobile phone, and you can save screenshots of bullying on websites or online chats. These can be useful if you report the bullying to your school or the police.</p><h3 id="">Support for victims of bullying</h3><h4 id="">Who can provide support for victims of bullying?</h4><ul>

			</ul><h2 id="">Boarders and school hostels</h2><h4 id="">How school hostels are regulated and managed</h4><p class="Body">Boarding hostels are generally run by independent governing boards, even if the hostel is attached to a state or integrated school. Hostels must be licensed under the Education (Hostels) Regulations 2005.</p><p class="Body">These regulations set out:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">minimum requirements for hostel premises and facilities, and for hostels&#x2019; management practices</li>
				<li class="Bullet">options for the Ministry of Education to intervene if a hostel doesn&#x2019;t meet the minimum requirements.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">A boarder or a boarder&#x2019;s parent can complain to the owner of a hostel about a breach of these regulations: see below.</p><h4 id="">Do hostels have to have written policies and rules?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education (Hostels) Regulations 2005, regs 54, 57</p><p class="Body"><span>Y</span>es. In managing the hostel the owners have to follow written policies and operating procedures.</p><p class="Body">The hostel&#x2019;s policies must ensure that its boarders:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">are supported in a positive learning environment</li>
				<li class="Bullet">are given the opportunity to develop positively within reasonable boundaries</li>
				<li class="Bullet">feel secure and valued</li>
				<li class="Bullet">have ready access to people they can trust and confide in, and are supported in raising issues that concern them</li>
				<li class="Bullet">have ready access to, and some choice about, health and other personal services they may need.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">Copies of the policies must be given to parents and boarders who ask for them. The hostel must review their policies at least every three years, and must consult with boarders and parents when they do these reviews.</p><h4 id="">What&#x2019;s the legal relationship between the hostel and the student/parents?</h4><p class="Body">The relationship between parents, students and the hostel board is a contractual one, like a commercial agreement. Each party agrees to carry out their part:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">The parents agree to pay fees to the hostel.</li>
				<li class="Bullet">The hostel agrees to provide food, support and a safe environment for the student.</li>
				<li class="Bullet">The student agrees to follow the hostel rules.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">A student&#x2019;s relationship with the hostel is separate from their relationship with the school, as the hostel and the school are different institutions. So if the hostel cancels a student&#x2019;s boarding contract, this doesn&#x2019;t mean the student is suspended or expelled from the school itself.</p><h4 id="">Policy on hostel relationships and treatment of boarders</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education (Hostels) Regulations 2005, reg 55</p><p class="Body"><span>A</span>ll hostels must have a policy that deals with relationships at the hostel, including relationships between the boarders and relationships between boarders and staff. This policy must help to make sure:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">that boarders are treated with respect and dignity</li>
				<li class="Bullet">that they&#x2019;re given positive guidance promoting appropriate behaviour, and in a way that takes into account each boarder&#x2019;s age and level of maturity</li>
				<li class="Bullet">that they&#x2019;re given positive guidance by the use of praise and encouragement, and that blame, harsh language, and belittling and degrading responses are avoided</li>
				<li class="Bullet">that when boarders are being given direction and guidance they&#x2019;re not discriminated against in any way (including by favouritism or hostility), they&#x2019;re not physically ill-treated or put in solitary confinement, and they&#x2019;re not refused food, drink, warmth, shelter, privacy or protection</li>
				<li class="Bullet">that boarders are physically restrained only in the types of situations specified in the policy and only in accordance with the restrictions in the policy.</li>
			</ul><h4 id="">When can boarders have contact with their parents?</h4><p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education (Hostels) Regulations 2005, reg 66</p><p class="Body"><span>P</span>arents must be able to see or have contact with their child whenever the child is at the hostel and there&#x2019;s no good reason for the hostel to deny this. A good reason for denying access or contact would include, for example, if a court order forbids it, or if a parent&#x2019;s behaviour would be likely to be disruptive.</p><h4 id=""><a id="Anchor-172">Wha<a id="Anchor-139">t happens if a boarder breaches a hostel rule?</a></a></h4><p class="Body">The law doesn&#x2019;t set out specific disciplinary processes for boarding hostels. Each hostel will instead have its own disciplinary policies and processes.</p><p class="Body">The hostel has a contractual obligation to follow the policies and processes it has adopted, as part of the hostel&#x2019;s contractual relationship with the boarder and parents. However, parents and students can also rely on an implied term of their contract that the hostel will behave fairly and reasonably.</p><p class="Body">The hostel should have provided the student and parents with a list of hostel rules. If for example the student drank alcohol at the hostel, and this is specifically forbidden by the rules, the hostel should:</p><ul>
				<li class="Bullet">interview each student involved in the incident and ask them for a response</li>
				<li class="Bullet">consider each student&#x2019;s response without prejudging whether or not they&#x2019;re guilty</li>
				<li class="Bullet">reach a decision based on the facts and evidence.</li>
			</ul><p class="Body">If the hostel rules clearly state that drinking alcohol can result in the student being expelled from the hostel, and the student is given a fair hearing, the board may be justified in cancelling their contract with the student and expelling them from the hostel.</p><p class="Body">The hostel&#x2019;s disciplinary policy may include an appeal procedure that you can use if you&#x2019;re not happy with a disciplinary decision.</p><h4 id="">Can a student be disciplined by the school for breaking hostel rules?</h4><p class="Body">The hostel and the school are separate institutions, and each will have to follow a proper process for dealing with misbehaviour according to their own rules. A student can&#x2019;t be automatically expelled from school simply because they&#x2019;ve been expelled from the hostel. Unfortunately, being expelled from the hostel often means the student won&#x2019;t have a suitable place to live and so won&#x2019;t be able to continue at <span>the school</span>.</p><p class="Body">If a boarder has breached the hostel rules, the school principal will need to consider whether any school rule has also been breached. For example, if the boarder drank alcohol in the hostel and the school rules ban alcohol from the school premises, the principal will need to consider whether the hostel is part of the school premises. If the principal decides a school rule has in fact been broken, they&#x2019;ll need to decide what action to take. If they formally suspend the student, the student will need to appear before a disciplinary hearing with the school board of trustees.</p><a href="3.
