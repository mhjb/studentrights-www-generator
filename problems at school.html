			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 3</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>E</span>veryone who is a New Zealand citizen or a permanent resident here has the right to free education at state schools from their fifth birthday until the end of the year in which they turn 19.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>N</span>o. Some schools have an “enrolment scheme”, which means you only have an automatic right to go there if you live in the school’s home zone. If the school doesn’t have an enrolment scheme, anyone can go there – see below.</p>
			<p class="Body">Also, girls don’t have a right to go to boys-only schools, and boys don’t have a right to go to girls-only schools. For more information on how this applies to transgender or gender non-conforming students, see below.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">If I have a disability, does that affect my right to education?</p>

			<p class="Body"><span>N</span>o. If you have special educational needs, whether because of a disability or some other reason, you have the same rights to go to state schools as other students.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4-first">What’s an “enrolment scheme” and why do some schools have them?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, ss 11A-11F</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>f a school has an enrolment scheme, this means the school has to accept all students who live in the “home zone” that’s identified in the scheme. Students who live outside the zone can only go to the school if they’re selected for a place under the rules of the scheme. Out-of-zone students are selected by balloting.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools can only adopt an enrolment scheme if this is necessary to avoid overcrowding. When there are more students who want to go to the school than there are spaces available, an enrolment scheme makes sure students are selected fairly and transparently, rather than having the school just choose whichever students it wants.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">How is a school’s home zone decided?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 11E</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>T</span>he school defines its home zone on the basis that the school is a reasonably convenient one for students living in that area. The enrolment scheme has to define the zone precisely so that any particular address is either inside or outside the zone.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">How are out-of-zone students selected?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 11F(1)</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>f you live outside the home zone, then whether or not you’ll be able to go to the school will depend on how many places the school has for out-of-zone students. To fill those out-of-zones places, the school has to follow an order of priority that’s set nationally, by law:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">1.&#9;</span>children who are accepted into special programmes run by the school (for example, special education or a Māori language immersion class)</li>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">2.&#9;</span>brothers and sisters of current students of the school</li>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">3.&#9;</span>brothers and sisters of past students of the school</li>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">4.&#9;</span>children of past students of the school</li>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">5.&#9;</span>children of school staff or of the board of trustees</li>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">6.&#9;</span>all other children who apply.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body">So if, for example, there are enough out-of-zone places to take all children from categories 1 to 3, but not enough for everyone in category 4, a ballot will decide which category 4 children will get to go to the school.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Who counts as a “brother” or “sister” for an enrolment scheme?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 11F(3)</p>

			<p class="Body">If you choose to take your child out of school anyway, this could technically be considered truancy. Even though it’s unlikely, you as a parent could be prosecuted (see “What can happen to me if I wag school?” below).</p>

			<p class="Body"><span>N</span>o, students who haven’t been immunised cannot be prevented from enrolling at school. However, the Ministry of Health recommends that all children complete their immunisations on time, particularly before starting school. Diseases can spread very quickly in the classroom environment.

All primary schools must keep an immunisation register of all students, showing which diseases they have been immunised against and if they are fully immunised. If parents do not provide their child’s immunisation certificate, the school must keep note of this.</p>
			<p class="Body">The school must keep the immunisation register confidential. However, if a student has contracted a serious infectious disease, the local Medical Officer of Health can look at the register without parental consent and contact parents of unimmunised students to offer immunisation.</p>

If you don’t make your children go to school, you could be charged and fined up to $30 for every day your child wags.

			<p class="Body">Attendance officers can detain students if they find them outside school, but they have to produce evidence of who they are, such as a badge. They can ask the student to provide their name and address, the name and address of their school, and the reason why they’re absent. If the attendance officer isn’t satisfied with the student’s response, they can take the student home or to the school they think the student is enrolled at. However, an attendance officer can’t go into the student’s home uninvited.</p>
			<p class="Body">A police officer has the same powers to deal with truant students as attendance officers.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">When Child, Youth and Family and other agencies may get involved</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’re regularly truant from school and the school has tried all options under its own attendance management plan, it can get the Ministry of Education’s Attendance Service involved. One of the service’s local organisations will then phone or visit your family to discuss your absence. They will work with you and your school to develop a plan to get you back into school.</p>
			<p class="Body">In some cases your school or the police may also contact Child, Youth and Family on the basis that you may come under the care and protection laws.</p>
			<p class="Body">If Child, Youth and Family become involved, they’ll probably call a family group conference (FGC) to look at the issues of concern. At the conference, your parents and other family members can talk about why you’re not going to school and can suggest solutions. The family group conference should develop a plan of action and Child, Youth and Family should make sure support is in place for you and your family.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4-first">What are “integrated” schools?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>ntegrated schools are schools that used to be private but that have now been “integrated” into the state system.</p>
			<p class="Body">They receive the same amount of government funding as state schools and have to teach the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span>, but they’re allowed to keep their “special character”, which is usually a connection to a particular religion or church. It can be a condition of enrolling at an integrated school that the student and parents agree to the school’s special character.</p>
			<p class="Body">Integrated schools can also charge a compulsory fee, called “attendance dues”. Integrated schools include, for example, Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Jewish, Islamic, Steiner and Montessori schools.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Private schools</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">What are a student’s rights at a private school?</p>
			<p class="Body">Enrolment at a private school is governed by a private contract (an agreement) between the school and the student’s parents, rather than by the Education Act and the other laws and regulations that govern state and integrated schools. When they enrol, parents and students are making an agreement with the school: the parents will pay fees and the student will obey the school’s rules, and in return the school will provide the student with an education.</p>
			<p class="Body">If there’s a dispute, including if the parents think the school has breached the contract, parents can use the court system. For small claims, parents can go to the Disputes Tribunal. It is a quicker, cheaper way of resolving disputes that sits outside of the formal court system. There are no lawyers or judges – instead a referee makes a decision.</p>
			<p class="Body">Although they’re not covered by the Education Act, private schools must still follow all other New Zealand law. As well as standard contract law, this includes the Privacy Act 1993, the Human Rights Act 1993, and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What curriculum do they teach at private schools?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">

			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>P</span>rivate schools don’t have to teach the same curriculum as state schools. They can develop their own curriculum and their own assessment standards, although these are reviewed regularly by the Education Review Office (ERO). The teaching standards must be at least as good as in state schools.</p>
			<p class="Body">ERO reviews each private school every three years. The review makes sure that the school has suitable premises, staffing and equipment, that it has a suitable curriculum and that the teaching is of a standard at least as good as in state schools.</p>
			<p class="Body">If it offers national qualifications like NCEA, the school will have to meet the standards set by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA).</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Disciplinary processes at private schools</p>
			<p class="Body">If the student breaches the school rules, they’ll be dealt with under the school’s specific disciplinary processes. However, parents and students can also expect that the school will behave fairly and reasonably. Any disciplinary process must be legal. For example, a teacher can’t smack a child, because that is against the law.</p>

			<p class="Body"><span>Y</span>ou do not have a <span class="itals">right </span>to home-school your child, but you can apply for a long-term exemption from enrolment. To do this, you’ll need to satisfy the Secretary of Education that your child will be taught as regularly and as well as they would be at school.</p>
			<p class="Body">You’ll need to provide enough information to prove that you are meeting these requirements. For example, the Ministry will want to see weekly timetables or routines that show you can teach in a planned way. You don’t need to teach the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span>, but you need a plan of what you’ll teach and how you’ll assess your child’s learning.

			<p class="Heading-4-first">Enrolment in a special school</p>
			<p class="Body">A special school provides specialist education or support for students with specific physical, behavioural, sensory or learning needs. This can include satellite classes and special units. Parents with children under the age of 21 years may enrol their child in special education at a particular state school, special school, special class or special clinic.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Te Kura: The Correspondence School</p>
			<p class="Body">This is a distance learning school where students who have become disengaged from school can work from home. It is a registered school which follows the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span>. Students have an assigned teacher that monitors them and assesses <span>their work</span>.</p>
			<p class="Body">There are two types of enrolment. If your child is eligible as a <span class="semibold">full time eligible student</span>, you will not have to pay fees and they will go on the roll. Your child may be eligible if they:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>compete in art or sports at an international level, which makes school attendance difficult</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>live a long way from any school</li>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>have severe psychological or psycho-social needs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">These criteria are subject to change. To see if your child may be eligible, contact Te Kura on 0800 65 99 88.</p>
			<p class="Body">Students can also be <span class="semibold">dual enrolled</span> – this means they remain enrolled at their current school, but receive extra tuition through Te Kura. This is government-funded in certain situations, including if the student has high health or educational needs.</p>
			<p class="Body">Any student can also pay to be dual enrolled at Te Kura.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Regional Health School</p>
			<p class="Body">Regional Health Schools provide intensive support for students with high health needs (for example, chronic or psychiatric illness). See <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.minedu.govt.nz</span></a></p>
			<p class="Heading-4">High and Complex Needs Unit</p>
			<p class="Body">A special unit is available to help students (usually aged between 6 and 14) who are a risk to themselves or others and who have complex and challenging needs that can’t be met by local services. The student must already by involved with more than one agency from the education or health sectors (including disability or mental health) or Child, Youth and Family. The unit brings these agencies together with the student and their family and whānau to develop a plan, and provides tools, resources and information. See <a href="http://www.hcn.govt.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.hcn.govt.nz</span></a></p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Alternative Education</p>
			<p class="Body">Students aged 13–15 with behavioural difficulties, or who are alienated or disengaged from school, may be able to enrol in an Alternative Education programme or an Activity Centre.</p>
			<p class="Body">Alternative Education programmes are funded by the Ministry of Education and are linked to a particular school. The Alternative Education student remains on the school roll, while being taught in small groups in a different setting. The school oversees the programme and is responsible for the student.</p>
			<p class="Body">There are advantages to working with students in the existing school environment. These include students having access to all school resources, and experiencing smoother transitions back into mainstream schooling, if this is in the student’s best interests.</p>
			<p class="Body">Activity Centres provide alternatives for students exhibiting “at risk” behaviour. They are places where students can have “time out” and then return to regular secondary schooling. They are also an alternative for those who aren’t coping with a regular school.</p>
			<p class="Heading-2">School fees</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">Can state schools charge fees?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-6">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 3</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>N</span>o. Every New Zealand citizen or permanent resident is guaranteed free enrolment and free education from their fifth birthday until the end of the year in which they <span>turn 19</span>.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-14">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Schools must clearly identify – in their prospectus, website information and notices to parents – that <span class="itals">all</span> charges for optional activities, including materials and services, are just that: optional. If a parent hasn’t agreed to their child doing the activity, they can’t be charged.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>T</span>he school can only charge for activities or services that are optional, and for items that students make at school but get to take home and keep. Schools can ask for voluntary donations, and parents can’t be forced to pay these donations. This is explained in more detail below.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4"><span>D</span>o I have to pay the “school donation” / “school fee”?</p>
			<p class="Body">Most schools ask parents to pay a specific sum of money towards running the school and providing additional services for students. This is normally called a “school donation”, and is a way of parents contributing to the school by topping up government funding. Schools should make it clear to parents that this is a voluntary donation and that parents don’t have to pay it. Unfortunately, some schools use the term “fee” or even “levy” to describe the voluntary donation, which implies that the parents have to pay it – this is wrong.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools can suggest an amount for the annual donation, but they can’t penalise parents (or the students) for choosing not to pay the suggested amount. In particular, schools can’t insist that the donation be paid before they’ll confirm the student’s enrolment at the school.</p>
			<p class="Body">The receipt the school gives you for your donation should state that it’s a donation, and the donation will qualify for an income tax rebate. The school shouldn’t include GST in any amount that qualifies as a donation, as schools don’t have to pay GST on voluntary contributions from parents.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can the school charge “activity fees” for course materials?</p>
			<p class="Body">Parents shouldn’t be charged for the cost of teaching or materials used in delivering the school curriculum, unless there’s a very clear take-home component. In subjects with a practical component, such as clothing and workshop technology, schools can charge for materials if the end-product belongs to the student and can, if paid for, be taken home.</p>
			<p class="Body">At the start of the year, parents should be made aware that charges for materials are a feature of courses in practical subjects.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’re uncertain or disagree about whether an activity is part of the school curriculum, you can contact the Ministry of Education about it.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can the school charge “activity fees” for activities and events?</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools often ask parents to pay specific activity fees for events or activities like field trips, school camps, and music concerts.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the event or activity isn’t part of teaching the curriculum but rather is something that enhances it (for example, a trip to see a play), then it’s legitimate for the school to exclude students who haven’t paid the admission price or travel costs. However, the school can’t send the student home during the activity, and must provide them with activities and supervision. This could involve placing the student in a different class while their class is on the trip. The school should also try to provide the student with an alternative experience or insight into the curriculum – for example, a video.</p>
			<p class="Body">If, however, a class field trip is an essential requirement for a subject (particularly at senior high school level), the school can’t charge an activity fee for this, as it’s part of the school curriculum and the school is funded by the government to deliver the curriculum.</p>
			<p class="Body">It’s reasonable for the school to ask parents to voluntarily pay a donation towards the travel costs associated with activities that are part of delivering the curriculum, like fieldwork in biology. But the school can’t exclude any students whose parents can’t or won’t pay. The school should also make every effort to minimise the costs, by holding the activity as close to the school as possible.</p>
			<p class="Body">It’s also reasonable for schools to ask parents to voluntarily contribute towards the cost of a school camp or a fun trip (for example, a trip to the botanical gardens), which is part of the broader school programme. But again, the school can’t require anyone to pay, and can’t exclude students who don’t pay.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-15">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: If you can’t afford an activity fee for take-home course materials or for optional activities, you should contact the school principal. In some cases, you may be able to negotiate an informal arrangement with the school, for example, a payment plan. You may also want to explore other avenues, such as an advance on your benefit from Work and Income.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>T</span>he school must tell parents in advance of any activity fees, and parents must be given the opportunity to agree to pay the charges. Schools may also ask for advance payment for optional activities during the year, but can’t insist on this.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4"><span>C</span>an integrated schools charge fees?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-16">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975, s 36</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>ntegrated schools can charge a compulsory fee – called an “attendance due” – but this can’t be more than the amount approved by the Minister of Education (which is published in the <span class="itals">New Zealand Gazette </span>– go to <a href="http://www.gazette.govt.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.gazette.govt.nz</span></a>). These dues should also be clearly set out in any prospectus or enrolment information. Attendance dues can be used only to improve school buildings and facilities or to pay for debts or mortgages that the school has on the school’s land or buildings. The school can’t charge parents interest on unpaid dues.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can we be refused a copy of the school magazine because we didn’t pay the donation?</p>
			<p class="Body">Some items, including school magazines, may be funded entirely through donations and not through the Ministry of Education. Schools may therefore have a right to withhold these items.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can the school refuse to issue a student ID card if we don’t <span>pay the donation</span>?</p>
			<p class="Body">This depends. Some schools fund their student ID cards entirely from school donations, in which case they could refuse to issue a card if the donation isn’t paid. However, the school should take into account that refusing to issue an ID card could have serious consequences for the student – for example, not being able to use the school library or get a student pass for public transport. This could amount to unfair and illegal discrimination against the student.</p>
			<p class="Body">It may be possible to work out a compromise – for example, the parents might be able to pay for the cost of the ID card alone.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can a school withhold a school report or leaving certificate because the family owes the school money?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-16">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">National Administration Guidelines (NAGs) 2, 2A</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>S</span>chools are legally required to report on a student’s progress and achievements to the student and to their parents. For students enrolled in years 1–8, schools must also provide a written report on the student’s progress and achievement in relation to the National Standards, at least twice a year. If a school tries to withhold school reports to “encourage” parents to pay the school donation or pay any money owed to the school, the school could be breaching its legal obligations.</p>
			<p class="Body">However, school leaving certificates are different from school reports. These are basically administrative, rather than recording educational achievement, as they record things like whether the student has returned all borrowed school items, has any outstanding amount owed on their account, or has been taken off the school roll. The school can therefore refuse to release a student’s leaving certificate if there is money owed on the child’s account (for example, for stationery that the family have chosen to get from the school), but not for unpaid donations. </p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-17">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Students and parents can also make specific requests under the privacy and information laws for all other information that the school holds about the student: <a href="#Anchor-160"><span class="xref">see “Getting information from the school”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">115</span></a>.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4"><span>D</span>ealing with debt collectors hired by the school</p>
			<p class="Body">If a board of trustees believes that money is owing to the school, it can take steps to recover that money, including hiring a debt collection agency.</p>
			<p class="Body">Parents should first check that this “debt” is in fact something they’re required to pay. Parents can’t be required to pay the school donation, as this is a voluntary contribution, even if the school describes it as the “school fee”.</p>
			<p class="Body">However, it will be legitimate for the school to hire debt collectors to recover charges that you do in fact owe – like the cost of lost or damaged library books, or charges for additional events or activities (like school camps) that the parents have agreed to pay.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you disagree that you owe the debt, or with the specific amount that the school is claiming, it’s important to write to both the debt collection agency and the school as soon as possible. If you can’t come to an agreement, ask for help from YouthLaw or your nearest Community Law Centre (see <a href="http://www.youthlaw.co.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.youthlaw.co.nz</span></a>)</p>
			<p class="Heading-2">The New Zealand Curriculum</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">Who decides what’s taught in schools?</p>
			<p class="Body">There are three levels in the curriculum (the subjects studied at schools).</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">1.&#9;</span>The national curriculum (called <span class="itals">The New Zealand Curriculum</span>)</li>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">2.&#9;</span>The school curriculum</li>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">3.&#9;</span>The classroom curriculum</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body">The <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span> sets the general framework for what is studied in all state and state-integrated schools. It sets out principles, values, key competencies and learning areas.</p>
			<p class="Body">The board of trustees of every state and state-integrated school must develop and implement a curriculum that’s based on the principles and values in the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span> and helps students develop the key competencies. However, schools have a lot of flexibility to decide how to shape their own curriculum to fit the needs of their own community.</p>
			<p class="Body">In the classroom, teachers decide how to tailor the national and school curricula to their individual students.</p>
			<p class="Body">For example, some of the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum </span>values are community and participation, ecological sustainability, integrity and respect. In line with these values and those of their community, a school might make the environment a focus of their curriculum. An individual class may then choose to study native plants and animals.</p>
			<p class="Body">To give another example, one of the values in the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum </span>is “excellence, by aiming high and persevering in the face of difficulties.” Renwick School recognises this at the school level through a “Give it a go kid” award, and at the classroom level through “personal best” tables.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Are there compulsory subjects that my school must teach?</p>
			<p class="Body">Yes. The <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span> sets out seven learning areas that are compulsory for students in years 1 to 10:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>English</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>The arts (dance, drama, music/sound arts, visual arts)</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Health and physical education</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Mathematics and statistics</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Science</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Social sciences</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Technology.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">All schools with students in years 7 to 10 should also work towards offering their students the opportunity to learn second languages.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Does my school have to offer swimming?</p>
			<p class="Body">Yes. Swimming is part of the <span class="itals">New Zealand Curriculum</span> and it is expected that all students will have had opportunities to learn basic aquatic skills by the end of year 6.</p>
			<p class="Body">The Ministry of Education doesn’t fully fund school pools, but they do provide operational funding which can be used either to run and maintain a school swimming pool or for travel and entry to a public swimming pool. Schools may also want to explore the possibility of using another local school’s pool.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">I think a teacher taught something inappropriate. What can I do?</p>
			<p class="Body">If a teacher taught material that you think was inappropriate for your child’s age, it would be best to begin by talking to the teacher about your concerns. If you still have issues, you can than follow the school’s general complaints procedure (<a href="#Anchor-147"><span class="xref">see “Fixing problems and making complaints”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">128</span></a>).</p>

			<p class="Body">However, the principal can’t also be expected to ensure the student is excluded at any other time just in case another student asks the teacher about part of the sexuality education curriculum.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Religious instruction</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">What is the difference between religious observance, instruction <span>and education?</span></p>
			<p class="Body"><span class="Headwords">Religious observance</span> involves things like reciting prayers and singing the hymns of a particular faith.</p>
			<p class="Body"><span class="Headwords">Religious instruction</span> involves teaching about a faith. It is not neutral; it assumes belief in that faith.</p>
			<p class="Body"><span class="Headwords">Religious education</span> (religious studies) is teaching about religion as part of a broader context. It should be neutral, and not favour any particular religious belief.</p>
			<p class="Body">Any school is free to teach religious education – facts <span class="itals">about </span>religions and the role of religion in society. This is compatible with secular education. The curriculum must be inclusive and reflect our cultural identity – no particular belief should be supported.</p>

			<p class="Body">It is only voluntary if students can opt out freely. Students shouldn’t be coerced into participating, and they must be supervised if they do not attend.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">When is a school closed for instruction?</p>
			<p class="Body">A school is “open for instruction” when an educational activity is taking place for students, like normal class activities. Schools are considered closed at lunchtime.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools can close for instruction for up to one hour per week for a maximum of 20 hours per year to allow religious instruction or observance. This is considered to be consistent with providing secular education, as it is outside normal teaching hours.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4">Integrated or private schools</p>
			<p class="Body">Integrated and private schools don’t have to provide a secular education. Many integrated schools have a special character based on religious belief. They can have religious instruction and observance without closing the school.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4">Can my child’s school have prayers or karakia at assembly?</p>
			<p class="Body">Although teaching in state primary schools must be secular, religious observance can be carried out when the school is closed for instruction. Depending on the circumstances, a school might be considered closed during an assembly.</p>
			<p class="Body">It is lawful as long as the school is closed for instruction, it doesn’t go beyond the time constraints, and students can opt out.</p>

			<p class="Heading-2"><a id="Anchor-162" /><a id="x.175264" />Special education</p>
			<p class="Body">New Zealand aims to have an inclusive education system. However, some students are denied access to some or all of the curriculum because they have a disability of some kind. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>children with behavioural difficulties not being allowed to go on school camp</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>parents being asked to keep “difficult” children home during Education Review Office (ERO) visits</li>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>a child with diverse needs facing a board of trustees disciplinary hearing for behaviour which is a recognised symptom of their medical condition</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">Many parents complain that they are being pressured to “voluntarily withdraw” their child, supposedly because another school may better fulfil the child’s needs. Parents are made to feel that their child is responsible for the fact that their classmates’ needs are not being met.</p>
			<p class="Body">It is important to note that “people who have special educational needs (whether because of disability or otherwise) have the same rights to enrol and receive education at state schools as people who do not”.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-6">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 8.</p>

			<p class="Body"><span>A</span>ll students, no matter what behavioural or other difficulties they have, are entitled to an education.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">My child’s needs aren’t being met at school – what can I do?</p>
			<p class="Body">If you are concerned about your child’s learning, talk to your child’s teacher or the principal. It is important that your child’s needs are assessed, so support can be provided and the most suitable programme can be developed.</p>
			<p class="Body">An Individual Education Programme (IEP) is a programme for students with special education needs, which can be developed by you, your child, your child’s teacher and specialists as appropriate. If you have an IEP, it should be reviewed at least twice a year, in a meeting with all those that developed it.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools are obliged to ensure the needs of all students are met, and a range of support is available to them. All schools receive a Special Education Grant (SEG) to help students with moderate behavioural and learning needs. Schools can also call on specially trained teachers, school-based resource teachers of learning and behaviour (RTLBs), who support and work within schools to assist staff and parents to meet the needs of students with moderate learning and/or behavioural difficulties. If your child has high social, behavioural or educational needs, you should talk to someone from Special Education at the Ministry of Education.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-13">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">For more detailed information on the help available, see the Ministry of Education’s resource, <span class="itals">Meeting Special Education Needs at School</span>, online at <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz"><span class="url url">www.minedu.govt.nz</span></a><span class="char-style-override-8"></span></p>

			<p class="Heading-4">Who qualifies for dedicated funding?</p>
			<p class="Body para-style-override-3">Students with special needs – who may have a variety of physical, sensory, learning or behavioural difficulties – are eligible for services and support through the Ministry of Education’s schemes. Some of these services are:</p>
			<p class="Heading-5">Ongoing Resourcing Scheme (ORS)</p>
			<p class="Body">This is available for a very small group of children (about one per cent of the school population) with severe difficulties and high or very high education needs. The funding can be used for a wide range of specialist services and support, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>physiotherapists</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>speech language therapists</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>educational psychologists</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>sign language interpreters</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>additional teacher time</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>teacher’s aides</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>visual or communication aids.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">Applications are usually made by school staff with the help of parents, and can be made at any time. Applications are assessed by verifiers (specialists from the Ministry of Education), who usually make their decision within three weeks.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 10.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>f an application for ORS funding is declined, you can appeal the decision. First, you can request that a different team of verifiers reviews the decision. Requests for review have to be made in writing within 6 months of the date the application was made. If your application has been reviewed and you’re still unhappy, you can appeal to the Secretary of Education. Appeals are conducted by an arbitrator, who is like an independent referee. The Secretary of Education must comply with the arbitrator’s decision.</p>
			<p class="Heading-5">School High Health Needs Fund</p>
			<p class="Body">This fund provides a teacher aide for students with significant health issues lasting more than 6 weeks. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>students with seizures who need constant supervision</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>students using oxygen bottles that need adult help to carry their equipment around school</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>students with cancer who suffer severe tiredness, nausea and vomiting.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">The fund doesn’t cover students who have high health needs resulting from an accident, as these are covered by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC).</p>
			<p class="Heading-5">Intensive Wraparound Service (IWS)</p>
			<p class="Body">The Intensive Wraparound Service is for students from years 3 to 10 with severe behavioural needs. It’s available for students who are struggling to stay at school due to their highly challenging behaviour, and who need support at school, at home, and in the community.</p>
			<p class="Body">Referrals usually must be made by a Resource Teacher Learning and Behaviour (RTLB) or someone from the Ministry of Education’s Special Education team. If the student already has ORS funding (see above), their school can also make a referral.</p>
			<p class="Body">If a referral is successful, a psychologist will work with the student, their family and whānau, the school and other agencies to develop a plan. Support is available for up to 3 years.</p>
			<p class="Heading-5">Interim Response Fund (IRF)</p>
			<p class="Body">This funding is available for urgent situations that require a short term response while a more long term plan is being implemented. It’s usually used when a school has exhausted all its resources and is unable to manage – for example, where a student’s behaviour is likely to cause harm to others if it is not immediately addressed.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools request the funding from their local Ministry of Education office. Applications are made over the phone, and are processed quickly once approved.</p>
			<p class="Body">Other specialists available through Special Education Offices include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>speech language therapists</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>special education advisers</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>advisers on Deaf children</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>occupational therapists</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>physiotherapists</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>registered psychologists</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>kaitakawaenga</li>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>behaviour, communication and other education support workers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Heading-4">Should a parent be told their child can only attend school for shorter periods because of funding shortfalls?</p>
			<p class="Body">No, this is not acceptable. It is a breach of section 8 of the Education Act (described in the introduction). Parents should enlist the services of staff from the Ministry of Education’s special education area to ensure that their child is appropriately provided for. Parents may also contact the Office of the Children’s Commissioner, which can help with information and advocacy.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Should parents be expected to top up teacher aide salaries?</p>
			<p class="Body">No. Parents are not required to contribute to staff salaries. A range of funding is available. School principals and boards of trustees should follow Ministry of Education policy and guidelines.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What happens when a student is suspended for behaviour that is a symptom of their disorder?</p>
			<p class="Body">Behavioural problems caused by recognised medical conditions wouldn’t usually be considered deliberate, and so wouldn’t amount to “continual disobedience”, because continual disobedience is when a student regularly and deliberately disobeys the school rules. There has to be deliberate non-cooperation or defiance.</p>
			<p class="Body">Before suspending a student for being continually disobedient, the school should be able to show it has made every reasonable effort to find ways to address the student’s behaviour.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools cannot:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>refuse to enrol a student because of disability&#160;</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>give a student with a disability less favourable terms of admission than those provided for other students</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>give a student with disabilities less benefits or services than those provided for other students</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>suspend or expel a student because of disability.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can a student be prevented from going on school camp due to their intellectual disability?</p>
			<p class="Body">No. The school camp is generally regarded as part of the school curriculum. It is unlawful to deny a student with disabilities the same benefits provided to other students, without reasonable justification.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools can access extra staff and funding for children with high or very high needs. Parents should argue that this extra funding could assist a child to go on camp.</p>
			<p class="Body">A parent should consider these questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>What (in terms of extra assistance or resources) does my child need to go on camp?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>How can that be provided?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Is it reasonable to expect the school to provide this extra assistance?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Can I help to get this extra assistance (for example, can I offer to parent-help for some of the time)?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Who can help me to get extra assistance? (IHC, for example, provides services to people with intellectual disabilities and their families.)</li>

For instance, for a school camp the school wouldn’t be expected to provide accessible toilet facilities for a student who uses a wheelchair. However, while the school wouldn’t be expected to modify the toilet facilities, they could employ someone to assist the child with toileting.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools are also not obliged to include students if this would cause an unreasonable risk to the student or others. However, all students should be included so far as it is safe to do so.</p>
			<p class="Body">Parents or caregivers should encourage discussion with the school to facilitate their child’s education.

			<p class="Body">The law on this has not yet been tested. However, the Human Rights Commission has said that “trans students should be allowed to wear the uniform that matches their gender identity”. If you attend a single sex school, they may not be able to develop a new uniform for you. However, they may allow you to modify part of the uniform, for example by wearing dress pants rather than a skirt.</p>
			<p class="Body">Transgender students should not be punished for wearing the uniform matching their gender identity, and bullying should not be tolerated.</p>
			<p class="Body">Many schools in the United Kingdom have begun to have gender neutral uniform policies. This involves having gender neutral clothing options (such as shorts) and, making all students subject to the same rules surrounding hair, nails and jewellery. This is supported by the Human Rights Commission and by the New Zealand Ministry of Education, which has suggested that schools consider offering a gender neutral option when uniforms come up for review. If you would like your school to consider this, you could bring it up with the board of trustees.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4">How can I make a complaint about my child’s teacher?</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’re having a problem with a teacher, it’s usually best to start by talking to them directly.</p>
			<p class="Body">If that doesn’t resolve things, or if you can’t speak to them for some reason, the next step is to talk to the principal. If you’re still unhappy with how it’s being handled, you can go to the school’s board of trustees. You can get the details of the chairperson from the school office, and write to them confidentially. If you like, you can ask to be present at the meeting where your issue is discussed.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4"><a id="Anchor-159" />Can I take my complaint any further?</p>

			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>You think the board of trustees won’t be able to deal with your issue because of a conflict of interest (for example, if the principal is married to the teacher you want to complain about)</li>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>There are other exceptional circumstances (for example, where the complaint is about incidents involving children who did not attend the teacher’s school, or where there is possible criminal offending).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">The Education Council is responsible for investigating the competence and conduct of teachers. Competence is about whether the teacher meets the criteria to do their job, and is an employment issue. Conduct is about behaviour that is unsafe. Serious misconduct includes things like physically abusing students, inappropriate relationships, neglect and fraud.</p>
			<p class="Body">To make a complaint, you need to fill out their complaint form. You can find this on their website at <a href="http://www.educationcouncil.org.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.educationcouncil.org.nz</span></a><span class="semibold"></span></p>

			<ol>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">1.&#9;</span><span class="semibold">Medical information.</span> Schools will usually ask for medical information when a student enrols. If they don’t, it’s important for parents to provide comprehensive information about their child’s allergy as soon as possible, including: what their child is allergic to (their allergens), the appropriate first aid response and medications, and emergency contact details (including their doctor). Parents might want to meet with staff to explain this further.</li>
				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">2.&#9;</span><span class="semibold">Staff training.</span> Schools must provide a safe environment for students (NAG 5(a)). Staff should be educated about allergies and anaphylaxis (a severe, potentially fatal allergic reaction). They should know the causes of allergic reactions and be confident in recognising them and applying first aid – including using adrenaline autoinjectors (EpiPens) if necessary. Face-to-face training is best, but free online training is available from the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy at <a href="http://www.allergy.org.nz"><span class="semibold">www.allergy.org.nz</span></a></li>

				<li class="number"><span class="char-style-override-5">4.&#9;</span><span class="semibold">Education of students and peers.</span> It’s mostly a parent’s responsibility to teach their child about their allergy and how to look after themselves.

			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>P</span>arents should usually be informed in writing of any activities that will take their children out of school grounds. However, schools might not need to get consent – it might be enough to post a notice in the newsletter or send a letter home.</p>
			<p class="Body">Whether consent is necessary, and what form it needs to take, will depend on the features of the activity, like:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>The duration – is it one hour, one day or one week?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>The location – on school grounds, in the local community or overseas?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Whether it is in school hours or goes beyond them</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>The risk involved.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">For example, if it’s a short activity in the local community during school hours, and involves a low risk environment – like a library or art gallery – it might not be necessary to get parental consent.</p>
			<p class="Body">On the other hand, your school might ask you to sign a blanket consent form at the beginning of the year to cover low risk activities.</p>
			<p class="Body">For activities which extend out of school hours or involve higher risk, the school should consider getting a signed parental consent form for each student.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you choose not to consent, the school should not take your child on the activity.</p>
			<p class="Body">Examples of activities and the kind of consent that might be needed:</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">I’ve been asked to sign a “risk disclosure” form for school camp – does this mean the school won’t be responsible if anything happens to my child?</p>
			<p class="Body">No. Sometimes with high risk activities, you might be asked to sign a risk disclosure form. This is good practice and is only intended to inform you of the risks involved in the activity – it <span class="itals">does not</span> remove the school’s responsibilities towards your child.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">My child was sent home from a trip early for misbehaving – do I need to meet the transport costs?</p>
			<p class="Body">If you were asked to sign a consent form, you should check it – you may have already agreed to pay the costs if your child is sent home early.</p>
			<p class="Body">Otherwise, you should contact your school to make an arrangement.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">I’m helping out at school camp, and I’ve been told I need to get a police check. Do I have to?</p>

			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>T</span>he Ministry of Education recommends that schools select volunteers carefully. They aren’t legally required to have volunteers vetted, but they may choose to. Schools are allowed to make a police check a condition of volunteering.</p>
			<p class="Body">There are other situations where school are required to carry out police checks. Non-teaching employees (like cleaners) must be vetted if they work during normal school hours. Contractors employed to work at the school (for example, doing building work) have to be vetted if they’re likely to have unsupervised access to students during normal school hours.</p>
			<p class="Body">Also, registered teachers need to have had a recent satisfactory police check in order to get their practising certificate.</p>
			<p class="Heading-2">Discipline and rules</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">A typical discipline structure in schools</p>
			<p class="Body">Many schools use something like the following structure for dealing with disciplinary problems, beginning with individual teachers and then, if necessary, involving more senior school staff:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>the subject teacher, or perhaps the head of department for that subject</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>the form teacher</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>the dean</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>an assistant principal or deputy principal</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>the principal.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">The school guidance counsellor may also become involved in disciplining a student, but counsellors usually prefer to stay outside the discipline process so that they can provide support for the student. <span class="xref">S</span><a href="#Anchor-151"><span class="xref">ee also “Students and confidential school counselling”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">121</span></a>.</p>

				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB"><span class="itals">Battison v Melloy</span> [2014] NZHC 1462</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>A</span>ny rule has to be precise and clear enough to allow students and parents to fully understand what a rule requires so they know how to act without breaking the rule.</p>
			<p class="Body">School rules must be fixed in advance. They should be in writing, and parents and students must be able to have access to them. The rules, and what happens if they’re broken, will usually be included in the school’s discipline policy.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Some guidelines for school boards in making rules</p>
			<p class="Body">Before it makes a rule, the board of trustees should consider the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="semibold">Have parents and students been consulted?</span> Although the board isn’t legally required to consult with them, it’s always a good idea to do so.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="semibold">Can the rules be legally enforced? </span>For example, a rule giving teachers wide powers to search students, beyond the search and confiscation laws that apply in schools, would be illegal. A rule will also be unenforceable if it’s too vague and uncertain.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="semibold">Are the rules reasonable?</span></li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="semibold">Is the rule appropriate for the particular age group?</span> For example, while a primary school rule might ban students from playing in the rain at lunchtime, it’s unlikely that the same rule could be applied to high school students.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="semibold">Are the rules relevant to the school’s educational role?</span></li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="semibold">How will parents and students be told about of the rules?</span></li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="semibold">What will the school do if the rules are broken? </span>A school rule can’t impose an automatic penalty. If a rule is broken, the school has to take into account all the circumstances of the particular case when it decides how to respond.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Heading-4">What sorts of behaviour is likely to be against the rules?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-22">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Schools can differ widely in what they expect of their students, and in the sorts of behaviour they find acceptable or unacceptable. For instance, if you question an instruction given by a teacher, some schools might see this as you simply exercising your right to be fully informed – but other schools might see this as you being rude and disrespectful.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>B</span>ehaviour that’s likely to be against school rules would include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>bullying</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>fighting</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>swearing</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>spitting</li>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>vandalism</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>stealing</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>behaving in a way that prevents other students or staff from doing their work</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>having illegal or banned items, like knives, alcohol, drugs, cigarettes or skateboards</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>gambling.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">Schools will also expect students to comply with certain standards – for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>being on time for class</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>being prepared for class, including having the necessary paper, pens and books, and having completed homework and assignments</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>participating in class work in a constructive way</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>wearing the correct uniform</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>bringing notes from parents to explain being away from school.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">Primary school rules may also include things like designated play areas and road safety.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">No automatic penalties</p>
			<p class="Body">A school rule can’t impose an automatic penalty. If a rule is broken, the school has to take into account all the circumstances of the particular case when it decides how to respond.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Scope of the school’s authority: When and where you’re under its control</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">Can the school have authority over me outside the gates and outside school hours?</p>
			<p class="Body">Your school usually doesn’t have any authority over you when it’s outside school hours, you’re not on school grounds, and you’re not representing the school in any way. For example, a school couldn’t suspend you for smoking cannabis at a private party at the weekend.</p>
			<p class="Body">In some situations the school could still have authority over you even though it’s outside school hours and you’re not on school grounds. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">In uniform / representing the school</span> – If you’re wearing school uniform you can generally be seen as representing the school, and therefore the school probably has authority over you. However, this hasn’t yet been tested in the New Zealand courts so the law is unclear.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">On school trips</span> – When you’re on a school trip the school will have authority over you. Your parents will usually be asked to sign an agreement before the trip.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">At special school events</span> – If for example you’re at a school ball, the school will have authority over you.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Travelling to and from school</span> – In general, you’re under the school’s control during journeys to and from school. This clearly includes when you’re travelling on school buses, but possibly also when you’re using public transport or walking or biking to and from school. You won’t be under the school’s control if you’re picked up or dropped off by your parents.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Damaging the school’s reputation – </span>A school may be able to punish if you harm its reputation outside school hours – for example, if you made serious accusations online about school staff or other students. However, the courts haven’t decided this question so it’s unclear.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">Whether a school has control over you when you’re outside the school gates could also depend on other factors like:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Distance from the school </span>– For example, a school could punish you if you swore at a teacher just outside the school gate, or if someone who lived nearby told the school they saw a group of students taking fruit from their trees on their way home.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Safety issues</span> – For example, a school could punish if you were seen near the school, just after school finished, throwing stones from a bridge on to cars below.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Heading-2"><a id="Anchor-158" />Punishments</p>
			<p class="Heading-3-first">School punishments that are legal</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">Written work</p>
			<p class="Body">Any written work the school gives as a punishment, such as lines and essays, should be reasonable and should take into account the particular student and their ability. For example, a dyslexic student shouldn’t be punished by being given extra writing to do.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Detentions</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’re given a detention outside school hours, it’s good practice for schools to give your parents advance notice, so they can make any necessary arrangements. The school can assume that your parents agree to the detention if they don’t tell the school they object.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’re given a lunchtime detention, you should still be given enough time to have lunch and go to the toilet.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-16">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 22</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>t’s quite common for schools to give a whole class a detention – “until someone owns up” or “because so many have been talking”. However, these whole class detentions may breach the Bill of Rights, which says a person can’t be detained “arbitrarily” – that is, without a good reason.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Extra work around school</p>
			<p class="Body">This can involve things like picking up rubbish, or sweeping and general cleaning.</p>
			<p class="Body">However, this work shouldn’t be done in normal class time and you must be given the equipment necessary for the job – for example, gloves for dealing with unpleasant rubbish. The school must make sure you’re safe.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Time-out, or sending students out of class</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 3</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>A</span>lthough “time-outs” can be helpful for both the student and the teacher, by giving a chance for the situation to cool down, they must be used carefully and not for long periods. Everyone in New Zealand over the age of five is entitled to an education, and sending students outside the classroom may violate this right if this is done too often.</p>
			<p class="Body">When deciding whether to use a time-out, teachers should take into account the psychological impact this would have on the particular student. Relevant factors will be how long the student will be kept isolated from other students and what the time-out room is like – that is, how big it is, and whether it has natural light and proper ventilation.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Taking away privileges</p>
			<p class="Body">A school shouldn’t take away a privilege from you if this could affect your education. For example, you shouldn’t be punished by being kept back from a trip to see a play or film that’s part of the English syllabus. The sorts of privileges that can be taken away are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>going to a sports game</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>going to a school dance (but only if it’s one organised by the school, rather than by, for example, the Parent Teachers Association or another group as a fundraising exercise)</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>going on a class outing, like a picnic.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Heading-4">Behaviour management programmes</p>
			<p class="Body">Programmes that help students learn self-discipline or change their behaviour – like anger-management and drug-awareness programmes – can be creative ways of helping students with behavioural problems. However, they shouldn’t be seen as a form of punishment but rather as a potentially effective tool for changing behaviour.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Being told off (reprimanded) in front of the principal and your parents</p>
			<p class="Body">This can be compared to a “caution” under the youth justice system when young people are warned at the police station by a senior police officer in front of their parents. In the school situation, a reprimand can take place in the principal’s office.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Daily reports</p>
			<p class="Body">The school can monitor a student’s behaviour through daily reports. Teachers fill in a report card and at the end of each day show it to the principal, deputy principal, dean or a nominated teacher.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Behavioural contracts</p>
			<p class="Body">Behavioural contracts are usually drawn up as a condition when a student goes back to school after they’ve been suspended (<a href="#Anchor-152"><span class="xref">see “Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">64</span></a>).</p>
			<p class="Body">The contract should be negotiated with you and your parents, rather than simply being imposed on you. It should be a two-way agreement, recognising the school’s duty to provide you with guidance and counselling as well as the conditions that you and your parents agree to.</p>
			<p class="Body">The contract should say exactly what’s expected of you, and set out some goals. These should be reasonable, realistic and achievable – you shouldn’t be set up to fail.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you breach the contract, the principal may ask the board of trustees to hold another meeting to discuss the situation. It shouldn’t be a condition of the contract that your parents have to withdraw you from the school if you don’t keep to the contract. Each case must be treated individually. The only way a school can suspend, exclude or expel you is through the school suspension/expulsion process (<a href="#Anchor-153"><span class="xref">see “When and how can a student be prevented from attending school?”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">65</span></a>).</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Punishments that are illegal or suspect</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">Physical (“corporal”) punishments</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-16">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 139A; <span>Summary Offences</span> Act 1981, s 9</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>P</span>hysical punishments are illegal – this includes all correction or punishment involving physical force, like hitting or slapping you, or using a strap or cane, or throwing things at you like pens or whiteboard erasers. Any deliberate use of force, or attempted force, against you could be an assault and therefore could justify a criminal complaint to the police, even if you’re not hurt.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you have in fact been injured, however, your parents should promptly take you to a doctor for a medical certificate. This can be used as part of a complaint to the school, or as evidence if criminal charges are laid.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Sending the student home</p>
			<p class="Body">Your school can’t send you home, even if only for a day or part of a day, unless the principal uses the formal stand-down or suspension process, and the necessary grounds for stand-down or suspension exist.</p>
			<p class="Body">You shouldn’t be sent home for trivial reasons like an incorrect uniform, or because the school doesn’t have the resources to deal with your special needs. These aren’t grounds that can justify a stand-down or suspension. The process and necessary grounds are explained in the chapter on stand-downs and suspensions from <a href="#Anchor-152"><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">64</span></a>.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Punishments that are cruel or degrading</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 9</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>C</span>ruel or degrading punishments are against the Bill of Rights. Examples include a teacher putting you down in front of the class, or making you stand or hold your arms above your head for a long period. Asking you to make an apology in front of the whole school might also fall into this category.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">“In-school” suspensions</p>
			<p class="Body">An “in-school suspension” is when the school, rather than sending you home, gets you to do work around the school for a day or two, instead of attending class. Arguably, this type of “suspension” is illegal, because if you’re attending school you have the right to take part in educational activities there.</p>
			<p class="Body">However, if you’ve been officially suspended, it’s legal for the school to ask you to return to school to participate in counselling or an educational programme that will help deal with your behaviour. A principal can also allow a suspended student to return to school to sit exams, if the parents have asked for this.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Using the power to excuse attendance as a means of punishment</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 27</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>P</span>rincipals have the power to excuse a student from attending school for short periods (up to five days) if the principal thinks this is justified – this might be used, for example, to allow you to attend a funeral or tangihanga. Schools can’t use this power to send you home for misbehaving: students who misbehave can only be removed from school if the principal uses the formal stand-down or suspension process (again, <a href="#Anchor-152"><span class="xref">see “Stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">64</span></a>).</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Taking action about illegal or inappropriate punishments</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">What can I do if I’m not happy about a punishment?</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’re not happy about a punishment that your school has given you, you and your parents could raise this with the school.</p>
			<p class="Body">Parents should make sure they’re aware of all the facts, and should ask the school for an explanation.</p>
			<p class="Body">You could suggest alternative types of discipline that you think will be more appropriate.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Outside agencies that can help</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’re not happy with the school’s response to your complaint about a punishment, you could contact an agency who can help you, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>the Children’s Commissioner</li>

			<p class="Body">It may be that the punishment was illegal, or breached the school’s charter or the National Administration Guidelines. The Student Rights Service, the Children’s Commissioner or your local Community Law Centre can tell you about this.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-23">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: The Education Review Office (ERO) is a body that checks whether a school is running as it should. If you send ERO a written complaint, they’ll file it and then check these concerns when its officers visit the school. However, if the complaint is particularly serious, or a number of students or parents voice the same concern, ERO can order a special audit of the school, or bring a planned audit forward.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body">If the punishment was legal, but you think it was too severe or inappropriate, or that your version of events wasn’t taken into account, you should approach the teacher concerned. If you’re not satisfied with the explanation, complain to the principal. You’re also entitled to take your concerns to the board of trustees – you should do this in writing and address your letter to the chairperson.</p>

But in all situations when students are being disciplined by schools, even when the law doesn’t set out detailed processes, students have the protection of some basic legal principles – called “natural justice”. In short, natural justice means you have to be treated fairly, and decisions affecting your rights (a suspension for example) should be made using fair processes.</p>
			<p class="Body">These natural justice principles are guaranteed under the Bill of Rights, which covers all bodies and individuals that are carrying out a public judicial (that is, court-like) function – this includes teachers, principals and school boards making disciplinary decisions.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4">What are the principles of natural justice that apply to students?</p>
			<p class="Body">Natural justice will usually require a school to do the following things when disciplining a student:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Right to be heard</span> – You have the right to speak and be heard. If a teacher thinks you’ve broken a school rule, they should talk to you and tell you exactly what the problem is and how the rule has been breached. They should also explain the effects of what you’ve done, if any, on others at the school. You should then be given a chance to explain what happened. You should only be punished if you can’t give a reasonable explanation.</li>

			<p class="Heading-2"><a id="Anchor-167" />Restorative justice</p>
			<p class="Body">Restorative justice is a way of thinking about and responding to harm. It’s an alternative way of managing relationships which originated in the criminal justice system. It can be used in a school setting in response to misconduct, and to reduce the number of stand-downs, suspensions and expulsions.</p>
			<p class="Body">It involves a different way of looking at things – the focus is not on punishment but on repairing harm and restoring relationships. A key principle is that the whole school community works together to both develop rules and to find ways to move forward when rules are broken.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What is a restorative approach?</p>
			<p class="Body">Depending on the situation and misbehaviour, it could range from an informal chat to a sit-down conference.</p>
			<p class="Body">It can involve the person who has caused harm, the person harmed, school staff, whānau, community members and, if necessary, the police. The purpose is to establish what harm was caused, why it was done, the wider emotional context, what is needed to put things right, and how the situation can be avoided in the future.</p>
			<p class="Body">It allows everyone involved to meet and gain a better understanding of the impact of the incident, the reasons it happened and the preferred outcomes.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Is it easy for schools to implement restorative justice?</p>
			<p class="Body">Not necessarily. It works best if the school is willing to invest time and resources. Schools will need to engage in a school-wide cultural change, which will involve staff training and regular evaluation. But schools who have done it suggest that it is worth the effort. Restorative justice fosters a culture of respect, takes a lot of stress out of the day-to-day school environment, and encourages high levels of student engagement.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">My child is the victim of bullying. If they have to face their bully, will they just get bullied more?</p>
			<p class="Body">No, not if the process is followed properly. Restorative justice focuses on victims’ needs, which many find empowering. Instead of making distressed people re-live trauma, restorative practice can give them the opportunity to express their anger and have their questions answered so they can move on.</p>
			<p class="Body">When young people are asked what they need when they have been harmed, their answers tend to be similar: someone to listen, time to calm down, acknowledgement of the impact, a sincere apology and reassurance it won’t happen again. Restorative approaches can meet all these needs.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">My child often gets in trouble but their teachers never listen to their side of the story. How would restorative justice help?</p>
			<p class="Body">When a young person behaves in a way that is challenging for a teacher, it’s likely that both student and teacher will feel some kind of grievance. Unless both feel heard and understood, it’s possible that the relationship between teacher and student will be damaged, affecting the way they work together in the future.</p>
			<p class="Body">Restorative justice allows a young person who has caused harm, on purpose or deliberately: time to think, a chance to explain, an opportunity to apologise, a chance to make amends, and reassurance the matter is dealt with and they can move on. More traditional, punitive approaches rarely provide the kind of environment that can meet these needs.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Is it a soft option?</p>
			<p class="Body">Not really. Restorative approaches are often more challenging, as students must face up to their shortcomings and are held to account in front of people who matter <span>to them</span>.</p>

			<p class="Body">You or your parents can also ask for a stand-down meeting, and the principal must then arrange one as soon as practicable.

			<p class="Heading-4-first">What is a suspension?</p>
			<p class="Body">A suspension is you’re formally removed from school by the school, initially by the principal but then by the board of trustees if the board decides to extend the suspension. Whereas stand-downs are usually only for several days, a suspension can be a week or more. Compared to stand-downs, suspensions are generally given for more serious misbehaviour, and in the most serious cases they can lead to the board deciding to permanently “exclude” or “expel” the student.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-14">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: In 2014, approximately 45% of suspensions were lifted at the suspension meeting (within 7 school days of the initial decision). Around 37% of students were excluded or expelled. The remaining 17% of suspensions were extended beyond <span>the first week</span>.</p>

			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14(1)</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>A</span> principal can suspend you if your behaviour fits into one of the following three categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>gross misconduct that’s a harmful or dangerous example to other students</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>continual disobedience that’s a harmful or dangerous example to other students</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>behaviour that is likely to cause serious harm to you or to other students if you’re not suspended.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">“Gross misconduct” and “continual disobedience” are explained in detail below.</p>
			<p class="Body">Those three grounds are the same as for stand-downs, but suspensions are generally used for more serious cases.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">D v Havill and Board of Trustees of Western Springs College (2009)</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>T</span>he principal, and later the board if it extends the suspension, must specifically identify which of these three grounds they believe applies to the particular case. If they don’t do this, the suspension is invalid and you can’t be prevented from attending school.</p>
			<p class="Body">A principal must choose either to stand-down or to suspend a student, and must follow through with the required legal process for the particular course they choose – they can’t do both.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What is “gross misconduct”?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-18">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14(1)(a); M &amp; R v Syms and the Board of Trustees of Palmerston North Boys’ High School (December 1990) [2003] NZAR 705</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body">“Gross misconduct” is serious misbehaviour. The courts have said it must be “striking and reprehensible to a high degree”, and not just trivial behaviour that children or teenagers could be expected to engage in every now and then. The misconduct must be serious enough to justify removing you from school even though this might harm your education.</p>
			<p class="Body">Whether an incident is gross misconduct will always depend on the particular situation. For example, in a case where students on a school ski trip were suspended for drinking alcohol, the judge said that whether drinking alcohol amounted to “gross misconduct” would depend on all the circumstances, and the school had to consider questions such as who had obtained the alcohol, how much was consumed, and whether the student was drunk.</p>
			<p class="Body">School policies can’t automatically label a particular type of behaviour as gross misconduct. The Education Act gives schools a discretion that shouldn’t be restricted by self-imposed rules that don’t allow for any exceptions. The school must allow for students’ individual needs and problems – for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>A student who steals might be from a disadvantaged background and be hungry.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>A student who has recently suffered some kind of trauma may need some leniency.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>A student who behaved destructively might require help rather than punishment.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">You can’t be suspended for gross misconduct unless your behaviour amounts to a dangerous or harmful example to other students.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What is “continual disobedience”?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-11">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 14(1)(a); J v Board of Trustees of Lynfield College (2007)</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>C</span>ontinual disobedience is when<span class="semibold"> </span>you regularly and deliberately ignore rules or refuse to do what you’re told. It’s not continual disobedience if you merely respond slowly or don’t do what you’re told: there must be an element of deliberate non-cooperation or defiance, and it has to happen more than once.</p>
			<p class="Body">Continual disobedience isn’t enough by itself for a suspension or stand-down – the behaviour must also be a harmful or dangerous example to other students. The school should consider whether your disobedience would undermine discipline and safety standards in the school if you’re not suspended.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">The principal’s decision</p>
			<p class="Body">The principal has to follow the rules of natural justice – basically this means they must act fairly at all times, must listen to and consider what you have to say without prejudging the situation, and can’t rely on any information or factors that are irrelevant to the case at hand.</p>
			<p class="Body">The principal should try to understand the context by considering any relevant information the school has and that parents may be able to provide. The principal isn’t legally required to talk to your parents before suspending you, but this may be a good idea. The information the principal has must be reliable enough to meet one of the three possible suspension grounds.</p>
			<p class="Body">It’s the role of the board of trustees to review the principal’s decision at the suspension meeting.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can the principal suspend one student involved in an incident, but not another?</p>
			<p class="Body">The principal has to consider all the circumstances and factors. Although two students may have done the same thing, it may in fact be fair to treat each student differently.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’ve been suspended but another student who was also involved in the wrongdoing wasn’t suspended, you can raise this issue with the board of trustees at its suspension meeting (see “The board of trustees’ suspension meeting” below). Be prepared to given reasons why you should be treated the same as the other student and be allowed to return to school; you could make some suggestions for alternative measures for the board to consider, like in-school punishments.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What are my rights if I have special needs?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Human Rights Act 1993</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>t may be illegal discrimination if you were suspended for behaviour that you couldn’t really help and that was the result of your disability. Even if the suspension is justified, it could still be illegal discrimination if the school didn’t have an appropriate behavioural plan for you and effectively set you up to fail.</p>
			<p class="Body">The question to ask is whether the school has done everything reasonable to meet your needs, taking into account the school’s obligation to maintain a safe environment for you and other students.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">What happens after the principal suspends a student</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">Principal must notify the parents, the board and the Ministry</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-11">

			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>A</span>fter suspending you the principal must immediately inform your parents, the board of trustees and the Ministry of Education. The principal has to state the reasons for the suspension – this includes explaining specifically which of the three suspension grounds they’re relying on and how what you did meets that ground (see above, “What types of behaviour can justify a suspension?”).</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-14">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Because suspended students stay on the school roll, the principal has to take all reasonable, practicable steps to provide you with guidance and counselling, in order to minimise the disruption to your education and facilitate your return to school when that’s appropriate.</p>

			<p class="Body">The issue then goes to the board of trustees for a decision (see below).</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-42">

			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>f the principal has suspended you, you stay suspended until the board of trustees holds a suspension meeting to decide what will happen. The meeting must happen within seven school days after the suspension, or within 10 calendar days after it if you were suspended less than seven school days before the end of term. The day on which you were suspended isn’t counted.</p>
			<p class="Body">If, for example, you’re told on a Tuesday afternoon that you’re suspended, the first of the seven school days would be the Wednesday, even if a letter formally notifying you and your family doesn’t arrive for another few days.</p>
			<p class="Body">The board has to hold the suspension meeting and make a final decision by the time limit. If it doesn’t, the suspension is over and you can go back to school. The meeting and decision can’t be delayed, even if both sides agree to put it off. The meeting can go ahead without you and your family being there (as long as the family had 48 hours’ notice).</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Getting notice of the suspension meeting and other information</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-11">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education (Stand-Down, Suspension, Exclusion, and Expulsion) Rules 1999, rule 15</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>A</span>s soon as possible, the board must let you and your parents know, in writing, the time and the place of the meeting. The board has to make sure you get this information at least 48 hours before the suspension meeting. This 48-hour period can only be reduced if everyone agrees.</p>
			<p class="Body">The information provided to you must be as complete as possible, and must include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>information about the procedure at the suspension meeting</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>a copy of the principal’s report to the board giving the reasons for the suspension</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>any other material about the suspension that will be presented at the meeting</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>the options available to the board.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">The principles of natural justice require that you get a fair hearing. If you become aware that a board member has a potential bias (for example, they’re related to someone involved in the incident), you should contact the board’s chairperson promptly to let them know this and suggest that the board member shouldn’t participate in the meeting and the board’s decision.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What if the parents withdraw the student from school before the board meeting?</p>
			<p class="Body">Parents shouldn’t be hasty in withdrawing their child from school to avoid them being excluded or expelled, as this can in fact leave the student worse off. When a student under 16 is excluded, the principal and the Ministry of Education have some obligations to help the student find a new school. Even if the student is 16 or older and has been expelled, the Ministry has the power to direct another state school to accept the student. Withdrawing voluntarily may therefore you won’t get any help from the principal or the Ministry. For more details, <a href="#Anchor-164"><span class="xref">see “What are my rights after I’ve been excluded or expelled?”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">84</span></a>.</p>
			<p class="Body">Note: Principals have to enter all stand-downs, suspensions and exclusions/expulsions into ENROL, the nationwide electronic enrolment management system. When a student is suspended, the principal must inform the Ministry of Education immediately, by submitting an “Advice of Suspension” form. After the board meeting has been held, its decision must be immediately communicated to the Ministry through an “<span>Advice of BOT Decision</span>” form. ENROL automatically checks that the process is completed before a student is withdrawn. If a school tries to remove a student from its roll without doing this, ENROL shows a warning message, stating: “The Ministry has been advised this student was suspended by your school. Please submit the ‘<span>Advice of BOT Decision</span>’ form before withdrawing the student.”</p>

			<div class="xref-box frame-6">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 17B</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>T</span>he suspension meeting is an independent review of the principal’s decision to suspend you. The principal doesn’t have a role in the decision, but as a member of the board can attend the meeting.</p>
			<p class="Body">You, the suspended student, can attend the meeting, along with your parents. You’re allowed to take someone to support or represent you, such as a lawyer, a church elder, a kaumātua, a youth worker, an advocate or a whānau member. A representative can support you and help you explain your side of things to the board.</p>
			<p class="Body">For the board’s meeting to be valid, at least half the trustees, not counting the principal, must be there. As most state school boards have seven or eight trustees, there must usually be four or five board members present. Integrated schools more commonly have 11 or 12 trustees, requiring at least six or seven members for a <span>valid meeting</span>.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4"><span><a id="Anchor-165" /></span></p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-12">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: It’s best that the student comes to the suspension meeting, as most boards like to meet the student and hear their side of the story. If the student can’t make it to the meeting, the parents could read out a letter from the student to the board.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Heading-4"><span>W</span>ha<a id="Anchor-132" />t you can do to prepare for the suspension meeting</p>
			<p class="Body">Before the meeting, you should plan what you’re going to say and prepare any letters or other documents that will support your case:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Responding to questions</span> – Prepare for any questions the board might ask (see below, “What sorts of questions will the board ask?”).</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Mitigating factors</span> – At the meeting you should tell the board about any mitigating factors – in other words, aspects of what happened that mean it’s not as bad as it otherwise might have been, or things about your situation that make it appropriate for the board to respond less severely. For example, you may have immediately tried to put right the harm or damage you caused, or what happened may have been out of character for you. You should explore the reasons behind what happened, and provide evidence that might back up your explanation – for example, medical or psychologists’ reports.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Witnesses</span> – You should provide statements from anyone who witnessed what happened. If the board’s chairperson agrees, witnesses will be able to come to the meeting and present their version of events in person. It’s a good idea to give the board written copies of any witness statements before the meeting (and also other documents like character references and an apology); but if you haven’t done this, bring copies to the meeting and give them to the board then.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Character references</span> – Bring along any character references or testimonials that might help your case – for example, from guidance counsellors, sports coaches or teacher aides.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Admitting the wrongdoing</span> – At the meeting you should acknowledge that what you did was wrong. You should show the board that you have a strong desire to stay at the school and that you’re willing to take practical, pro-active steps to prevent the same thing happening again. Bear in mind that board members are parents too, and they’ll be concerned for their own children about safety and discipline at the school.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Apology</span> – Write a letter of apology to the board, and also prepare a verbal apology to present to the board when it’s your turn to speak at the meeting.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Conditions</span> – Be ready to accept any reasonable conditions that the board might impose as part of its decision.<div class="xref-box frame-15"><p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: A student is far more likely to present a good case to the board if they genuinely want to return to school. Parents should therefore take the time to talk to their child and discuss whether they actually want to return to school – and if not, why not. Parents should also be careful not to suggest anything to the board that the student won’t be willing to agree to.</p></div></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Heading-4"><span>W</span>hat’s the process at the suspension meeting?</p>
			<p class="Body">There are no legal rules or regulations dealing with the procedure at suspension meetings. The format and process for the meeting will be decided by the board. Usually, however:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>the meeting will begin with the principal reading out their report for the board to consider</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>then the student, the parents or their representative will tell their side and provide reasons why the student should be allowed to stay in school</li>

			<p class="Body"><span>T</span>he meeting usually begins with the principal reading out their report for the board to consider.</p>
			<p class="Body">The Education Act doesn’t give the principal any authority to recommend what the board should do. You and your parents will have been sent a copy of the principal’s report before the meeting, and if you find any recommendations in it you should contact the principal and ask them to take out those recommendations. If, at the meeting, the principal makes a recommendation that’s not in their report, you can raise this issue at the meeting and remind the board that it’s their responsibility to review the principal’s suspension decision and make their own decision.</p>

			<div class="xref-box frame-13">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Regardless of the principal’s view that a school rule has been broken, the board should consider whether you the student in fact effectively complied with the school.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>A</span> key principle of natural justice prevents the principal from taking part in the decision about whether to lift or extend a suspension, because they’re the person who initiated the suspension. The principal is like the “prosecutor”, so they can’t also be one of the judges. Although they’re a member of the board, the principal shouldn’t remain with the board when it’s making its decision. The principal should leave the board meeting at the same time as you, your family and representatives.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the board wants to call the principal back into the meeting to provide any other information, then you, your family and representatives should also called back in and be given a chance to question the principal.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-13">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Any teacher, parent or other student who was directly involved in the incident that led to the suspension shouldn’t be involved in any of the school’s decision-making about the incident.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body">If the principal (or any board members) raise any new information or issues that you or your parents haven’t heard about before, you can ask for the meeting to be adjourned (put off to a later date) so that you can consider the new information, and perhaps also get advice from a lawyer. If the meeting is adjourned, parents should get back to the board as soon as possible, as the board must make their decision within the seven-day (or 10-day) time limit.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4"><span>Telling your side of the story at the meeting</span></p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 13(c)</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>A</span>fter the principal has read their report to the board, usually the next step in the meeting is that you, your parents or your representative tell your version of what happened. The right to tell your side of the story, after having had adequate time to prepare your case, is a key principle of “natural justice”. Natural justice is specifically mentioned in the part of the Education Act 1989 that deals with suspensions <span>and expulsions</span>.</p>
			<p class="Body">The board will want to hear you admit that what you did was wrong and show them that you’re willing to change. They’ll want to hear you that you’re keen to return to school, and you should give them reasons why you think you should be allowed to go back. It’s a good idea to list some practical steps that you plan to take to prevent the incident happening again. For some detailed advice on putting your case at the meeting, <a href="#Anchor-165"><span class="xref">see “What you can do to prepare for the suspension meeting”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">77</span></a>.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you don’t agree with the principal’s report and any other information the board is looking at, it’s important that you and your family put forward your version of the facts and explain why you disagree. This can make a difference to the board in deciding whether you’ll stay in school.</p>
			<p class="Body">You may choose not to say anything about what happened. However, the board can still form a view about what happened and might draw conclusions from your silence – for example, they might think that you agree with what the principal has said. If the board does draw conclusions, they should let you know and invite you to comment, without pressuring you to provide answers or explanations.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What sorts of questions will the board ask?</p>
			<p class="Body">When you tell your side of the story at the suspension meeting, the board of trustees is likely to ask the following types of questions (if you haven’t already dealt with these issues):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Do you agree with what the principal has said?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Do you admit that what you did was wrong and not acceptable?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Are you sorry for what you did?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Can you explain your behaviour?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>What effects do you think your behaviour has had on others?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Why do you want to come back to school?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Why should the board allow you to come back to school?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>How would you change your behaviour if you were allowed to return to school?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>How can the board be confident that you will in fact change your behaviour?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Why should the board believe the things you have to say?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">Before the meeting, parents should help make sure the student is well prepared to answer each of those questions. This doesn’t mean giving the student the answers or putting words into their mouths – it means getting them to think in advance about how they’ll respond to questions. A good way to prepare is to role-play the suspension meeting, with the parents as the board of trustees.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">When and how the board makes its decision</p>
			<p class="Body">After hearing from you, your parents or your representative, the board of trustees will usually ask you and your parents to leave the room so they can discuss the issues and make a decision. However, the board might decide to ask you all to stay so that everyone can try to reach agreement about what should happen.</p>

The rules in the Education Act provide for a range of responses for cases of varying levels of seriousness, and the board has the option of lifting the suspension and imposing various conditions.</p>
			<p class="Body">Before it makes a decision, the board has to consider your circumstances, weigh up all the factors, and consider all options. In one court case where the board’s decision was overturned, the judge found that the board’s failure to consider the possibility of lifting a suspension, subject to conditions, meant that the school hadn’t treated the student fairly.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>f you’re under 16 and have been excluded from your school, the principal has to try to help you find another school that’s suitable for you and reasonably convenient for where you live. However, other schools can refuse to accept you, and therefore it can be very difficult to find another school. If the principal can’t find one within 10 days, they have to tell the Ministry of Education.</p>
			<p class="Body">The Ministry can then either lift the exclusion and allow you to go back to your school (if they think this is appropriate), or direct another school to accept you, or direct your parents to enrol you with the correspondence school. However, the Ministry only rarely uses those powers.</p>
			<p class="Body">Before it can lift the exclusion or direct another school to take you, the Ministry has to consult with you and your parents and with the relevant school board. It can also consult with other people or organisations about your education or welfare if it thinks this is appropriate.</p>
			<p class="Body">Note: If you’ve been excluded from a school and you’re looking for a new school to go to, other schools can refuse to accept you while you’re currently excluded. However, this doesn’t mean that just because you were <span class="char-style-override-15">once</span> excluded from a school, any other school can continue to refuse you. If you’re excluded from school A, but you’re taken in by school B, then school C can no longer refuse to accept you if you’re otherwise entitled to go there (for example if you’re in school C’s home zone). The only exception is the school that excluded you – they can continue to refuse to accept you indefinitely.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’re 16 or older and have been expelled, the principal doesn’t have to help you find another school. However, the Ministry of Education may still decide to help you find one, and can direct a state school to accept you.</p>

			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Ask the board to reconsider</span> – You’ll need to be clear about exactly why you think the process at the board’s meeting wasn’t fair. To ask for a reconsideration meeting, you should write a “Request for reconsideration letter” to the chairperson of the board, care of the school (<a href="#Anchor-169"><span class="xref">see “Sample letters”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">134</span></a>).</li>

This is free and can be done by phone or in writing. The Ombudsmen can’t overturn the board’s original decision but they can investigate your complaint and if they find that it’s justified (for example, there’s been some breach of process), the Ombudsmen can recommend to the board that it reconsiders its decision. However, the Ombudsmen’s investigation can take several months and you many need to enrol in another school in the meantime.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Go to court</span> –If you challenge the decision through the courts, you’ll need to apply to the High Court, and for this you’ll need a lawyer. Note that Parliament has assigned decision-making authority to school boards. This means that the Court will focus on whether the legal rules have been applied correctly rather than examining the facts in detail or substituting their view for the board’s. Again, this will take a long time and will be expensive, as legal aid is not available for cases involving schools.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Discrimination complaint</span> – You can complain to the Human Rights Commission if you think the board’s decision discriminated against you.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span><span class="Headwords">Complain to Education Review Office</span> – You can complain to ERO about the way the school runs its disciplinary system. ERO reviews schools on average once every three years, and they may decide to review a school more often if the school’s performance is poor and there are risks to the education and safety of the students. ERO reports are available to the public.</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="Heading-4">What’s the most effective way to challenge a board’s decision?</p>
			<p class="Body">Asking the board of trustees to reconsider is likely to be the fastest and most effective way of changing the board’s decision. With the other options explained above, it may be a number of months – even years – before the decision is changed, assuming you have a good case.</p>
			<p class="Body">In particular, asking the board to reconsider its decision will be the appropriate option if the board didn’t have some important information when it made its decision, or if you have a reasonable argument that the process the board followed was somehow unfair.</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="Body">This is because of the school’s responsibility to provide a safe physical and emotional environment for all students.</p>
			<p class="Body">The principal should seek advice before deciding whether it’s necessary to send a student home on health grounds. They must also apply this law consistently.

			<p class="Body">Students can’t be sent home or out of school for disciplinary reasons except under the formal stand-down or suspension process in the Education Act.</p>
			<p class="Body">However, schools have sometimes used other – illegal – ways of removing a student from school (sometimes called “Kiwi suspensions”), explained below. If this happens in your case, there are ways for you to challenge and overturn the decision.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Sending students home without the formal stand-down/<span>suspension process</span></p>
			<p class="Body">There are many different circumstances in which schools have illegally sent students home or out of school. For example, when a student with dreadlocks is sent home and told not to come back “until you’ve cut them off”, or when a student is sent home for not wearing the correct uniform, or when parents of special needs children are told to keep their children home because the teacher aide is away from school.</p>

			<p class="Body"><span>P</span>rincipals have the power to excuse a student from attending school for short periods (up to five days). An example of this could be if the student needs to attend a funeral or tangihanga. However, schools <span class="semibold">can’t</span> use this power to send a student home for misbehaving.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Voluntary withdrawal at the school’s request</p>
			<p class="Body">Sometimes principals try to get rid of students they believe are difficult or uncooperative by telling parents they should withdraw their child “before they’re excluded or expelled”. This may be put to parents as being in the student’s best interests – a chance to put their past behind them and make a fresh start in a new school. Sometimes the option is presented as follows: “We don’t seem to be meeting your daughter’s needs and we feel she may be able to better reach her potential at another school.”</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools may try to deal with “problem students” in this way if they know the student couldn’t be suspended legally, or that the board would be unlikely to exclude or expel the student. “Voluntary withdrawals” are especially common for students with behavioural difficulties.</p>

The school has an obligation to support each of its students if there are problems. In particular, principals have to take all reasonable steps to make sure that students get good guidance and counselling.</p>
			<p class="Body">Remember that principals don’t have the power to exclude or expel a student: only the board of trustees can do this, and only after following the proper process and hearing from the student and the parents: for more information <a href="#Anchor-170"><span class="xref">see “The board of trustees’ suspension meeting”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">76</span></a>.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4-first">When and how can I be suspended or expelled from a private school?</p>
			<p class="Body">Private schools aren’t bound by the rules in the Education Act for suspensions and exclusions/expulsions. Instead, discipline in private schools is governed by each school’s own rules and processes. However, parents and students can rely on an implied term of their enrolment agreement with the school that the school will behave fairly and reasonably.</p>

			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 35Q</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>A</span>lthough suspension and expulsion decisions in private schools are governed by each school’s own rules, the Education Act does specify what has to happen after the student is suspended or expelled.</p>
			<p class="Body">First, the principal must immediately notify the Ministry of Education. If you’re under 16 and you’re not back at school or at a new school within a reasonable time, the Ministry has to make other arrangements for you.

			<p class="Body">If you’re 16 or older, the Ministry doesn’t have to do any of those things, but it can choose to do so.</p>
			<p class="Body">Before it directs a state school to accept you in one of these cases, the Ministry has to consult with you, your parents and the new school’s board.

				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 72; New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 14</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>M</span>ost New Zealand secondary schools, and some primary and intermediate schools, have rules requiring students to wear a school uniform. This comes under a school board’s powers to make any rules it thinks are “necessary or desirable for the control and management of the school”.</p>
			<p class="Body">Technically, a school uniform rule won’t be legally enforceable if it breaches students’ rights of freedom of expression under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. However, the New Zealand courts would probably see most school uniform codes as being a reasonable and allowable restriction on a student’s right to freedom of expression.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can I be punished for not wearing the uniform?</p>
			<p class="Body">This would depend on the particular case.</p>
			<p class="Body">You shouldn’t be punished if your parents or caregivers can’t afford to buy a uniform. Parents should talk to the school, which may have second-hand uniforms that can be bought cheaply. Parents who are on a low income or benefit may be able to get financial help from Work and Income.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4">Can students wear items of cultural or religious significance?</p>
			<p class="Body">Yes. It’s illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, gender, or national or ethnic origin, and so, for example, the Human Rights Commission has upheld the right of Māori students to wear taonga at school, despite uniform codes that ban jewellery.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools can ask, however, that students provide a genuine reason for wanting to wear items of cultural and religious significance.</p>

			<p class="Body"><span>A</span>lthough it’s illegal for schools to treat students differently on the basis of gender, this probably doesn’t prevent different school uniform codes for male and female students.</p>
			<p class="Body">In one case (from 1991) the Human Rights Commission agreed with a complaint by two female-identified students who claimed that the school requirement to wear a skirt disadvantaged them because it restricted their activities and therefore it amounted to discrimination on gender grounds. This particular case was settled by the school agreeing to change its uniform so t<a id="x.175491" />hat female students could choose to wear “culottes” (shorts that look like skirts). This case shows that the current law is probably that schools can have different uniforms for male and females, but that the particular uniforms can’t disadvantage one gender or any other particular group.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>T</span>he law here isn’t clear. In the 1970s, the Court of Appeal upheld a school’s right to enforce rules about hair. However that decision is now more than 40 years old, and it was made before the Bill of Rights was passed, protecting the right of freedom of expression.</p>
			<p class="Body">In a 2014 High Court decision (<span class="itals">Battison v Melloy</span>), the judge found that the particular hair rule in this case wasn’t legally enforceable because it wasn’t certain enough. In this case, the school board had agreed with the principal’s decision that the hair rule had been broken. However, the judge disagreed with the board’s decision because the board hadn’t independently considered whether the student’s offer to wear his hair in a bun amounted to effective compliance with the rule (which didn’t specifically say that a student’s hair had to be cut short).</p>
			<p class="Body">The judge in <span class="itals">Battison v Melloy</span> said that schools should carefully consider whether a proposed hair rule would breach students’ rights to autonomy and individual dignity, and their right to freedom of expression under the Bill of Rights. The judge said that it would be unlawful to make a rule which gave the principal complete discretion to decide whether a student’s dress and appearance was acceptable.</p>
			<p class="Body">There will also be exceptions for students who can show that they have a genuine reason for keeping their hair long. For example, hair length has religious significance for Sikhs and cultural significance for Rastafarians. A student’s personal preference would not suffice as an acceptable reason.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Challenging a rule about uniform or appearance</p>
			<p class="Body">While schools have the right to make rules, students and parents who are unhappy about a particular rule should ask the school why the rule exists – is it, for example, for safety reasons? You should think about these questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>How important is this issue to you? Is it important enough to risk disrupting your education?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Why is the issue important? For example, are religious or cultural values involved?</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>What are the possible consequences of continuing to challenge the rule?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">Sometimes schools and families can become hardened in positions they’ve taken about an issue. There are sometimes no easy answers. If you’ve carefully thought about the issue and want to pursue it further, you can contact one of the agencies listed at the back of this booklet (<a href="#Anchor-154"><span class="xref">see “Useful contacts”, </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">139</span></a>).</p>

			<p class="Body">The teacher doesn’t need to be absolutely certain you have the item in order to have a “reasonable” belief. What’s reasonable will depend on the context, and also on the type of item the teacher thinks you have. Reasonable grounds can be based, for example, on information from other students. But it wouldn’t be reasonable for the teacher to make assumptions based on what you’ve done in the past. That means even if they have found a harmful item on you before, they must not use this as grounds for searching your clothes or belongings if they have no other evidence.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">My school has a policy that students and their property can be searched by school staff – is this legal?</p>
			<p class="Body">No. The school can only carry out searches as allowed by the search and confiscation powers explained in this section. Students also can’t be asked to consent to something that’s outside those powers.</p>
			<p class="Body">The school may argue that by being enrolled at the school, you and your parents have agreed to this policy, but this is incorrect, as schools can’t adopt policies that breach New Zealand law.</p>
			<p class="Body">However, if you freely volunteer to empty your bag (for example, because you’re keen to prove you’re innocent), then that is fine.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can the school strip-search me?</p>

			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>N</span>o. However, if you refuse to remove your outer clothing when asked, or refuse to hand over a bag or container, the school can take reasonable disciplinary steps against you.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can schools do blanket searches of whole classes or groups of students?</p>
			<p class="Body">No. If, for example, something has apparently been stolen, the school can’t do a blanket search, even for a harmful item. For a teacher to be able to use the power to search students’ outer clothing or bags for harmful items, the teacher must have a reasonable belief relating to <span class="semibold">each</span> student.</p>
			<p class="Body">If a stolen item isn’t harmful – a pair of shoes, for example – and the teacher has a reasonable suspicion that a particular student has it, the teacher can demand that the student return the item. If the student doesn’t return it, they can be disciplined.</p>
			<p class="Body">The police can be called if the school thinks this is appropriate.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can a school search my locker?</p>
			<p class="Body">A school can search its own property at any time for any reason. This includes lockers and desks provided to students for storage, like lockers and desks. If you freely choose to use a school-provided storage area, the school will be free to search it. The terms and conditions about the use of lockers should state that the school can search your locker and any bag or container in it.</p>
			<p class="Body">This doesn’t mean that a school can search your bag whenever you leave it somewhere. If you’ve only left your bag somewhere temporarily – for example, on a hook in the changing room during a single PE class – you probably haven’t given up control of it. This means your bag could only be searched if a teacher reasonably believed it contained a harmful item.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you don’t want your school to be able to search your bag at any time, it is best not to leave it in a school-provided storage area.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">If teachers think a student has something illegal, can they hold them until the police arrive?</p>
			<p class="Body">The school can keep you under supervision until the police arrive. If you leave, the school can discipline you. If you leave the school grounds, you’ll be considered truant.</p>
			<p class="Body">The laws on searches and confiscations in schools don’t affect the powers that the police have. The police can carry out searches if these are lawful and reasonable, and this will depend on the circumstances in each case. For example, if police have reasonable grounds to believe drugs are involved, they can search you without your consent. The police, like the school, can’t carry out “blanket searches” of whole groups or classes of students – to carry out a search of any student or their property, the police have to have reasonable grounds that relate specifically to that student.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the police want to search you, you should say clearly that you don’t consent to the search, but it is best not to resist. If you think the search was carried out roughly or without good reason, you should complain to the Independent Police Conduct Authority – <a href="http://www.ipca.govt.nz"><span class="url semibold">www.ipca.govt.nz</span></a><span class="semibold"></span></p>

			<p class="Heading-4">What are my rights when school staff interview me about a crime?</p>
			<p class="Body">Your rights in this situation aren’t covered by legislation, as they are when being interviewed by police. Generally, a school’s duties are about education and safety at school. The school shouldn’t question you about things that happen outside of school, unless they directly affect the school or your education.</p>
			<p class="Body">If school staff have a reason to interview you about criminal activity happening at school, you have the following rights:</p>
			<p class="Body"><span class="itals">Principles of natural justice</span></p>
			<p class="Body">The school should:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Act in good faith, without bias. This means they should be fair.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Give you a chance to tell your side of the story</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="Body"><span class="itals">United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child, article 40</span></p>
			<p class="Body">You have the right:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>To be presumed innocent until proven guilty</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>To be told what you’re accused of</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>To have your parents or guardians with you</li>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>To have your privacy fully respected at all stages of the interview.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">This means that before questioning you, your school should:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Tell you what you are being questioned about or accused of</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Ask you if you would like to have your parent, guardian, or another adult to with you. If you don’t want your parent there, you could ask for the guidance counsellor or another teacher.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">If you feel a teacher or principal was overbearing or forced you into anything, you should tell another adult. This might mean the interview was unfair, and the information they got might not be able to be used against you.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can I be made to sign a statement or confession?</p>
			<p class="Body">No. You can’t be made to sign a statement, and if the school asks you to, you should think about it carefully.</p>
			<p class="Body">Sometimes the school might ask you to sign a statement confessing or accusing another student of an offence. Questioning students shouldn’t involve written statements or confessions. But if the school does ask you to sign something, you should talk to your parents or another adult and consider:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>The purpose of the document and why you’re being asked to sign it</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Whether the document is going to be used in evidence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">It’s unlikely that a statement could be used as evidence in court, unless all the legal safeguards had been followed.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the school plans to use the statement for another purpose (like a board of trustees disciplinary meeting) the principles of natural justice and UN Convention on the Rights of the Child must be followed (see above).</p>
			<p class="Body">Any staff member that asks you to sign a statement should:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Explain that you don’t have to sign</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Explain where and how the statement might be used</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Suggest that you get legal advice before signing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">You should never be forced to sign something by threats of what will happen if <span>you don’t</span>.</p>
			<p class="Body">You and your parents should feel free to discuss any concerns with the staff involved, the principal and the police.</p>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Support them during a statement, if they agree to make one.</li>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Understand how they communicate</li>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>Learn what they want to say during the interview.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">It’s a good idea to encourage the young person to get some legal advice as soon as possible, and to make sure they get it. It’s unlikely that they will know a lawyer, so they should be given the names of some lawyers who they could talk to over the phone or in person. The questioning police officer should be able to give you a list.</p>
			<p class="Body">During the police interview, you should provide support. You should make sure the young person understands the questions, can answer them as they want to, and is understood properly. Your role is to make sure they are not disadvantaged.</p>

The police must let parents or guardians know when a young person is being questioned at a police station, even if the young person nominates someone else as a support person.

			<p class="Heading-4"><span>W</span>hat if my child says, “I don’t want my parents to be contacted”?</p>
			<p class="Body">If the student is at a police station and under 17 years old, the police must inform their parents or guardians. If the student is 17 or over, the police do not have to do this.</p>
			<p class="Body">At school, whether parents are contacted will be up to the school policy, however, it is the school’s duty to inform parents of matters which, in the principal’s opinion, are affecting students’ progress or harming their relationship with other students.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What is the school’s role if the police are questioning my child at school?</p>
			<p class="Body">The school’s role is not clearly defined by legislation. If a teacher attends the interview as a young person’s “nominated adult” supporter, they have the duties set out above. If the teacher is not the student’s nominated adult, the teacher has no automatic right to be there. They can be there only if police and the student both consent.</p>
			<p class="Body">For young people, the consequences of admitting guilt, or getting a conviction, can be very serious. Schools should stress the student’s right to consult a lawyer, and help them to take advantage of this right. Teachers should also be aware of the young person’s right to silence, and make sure that the student is not pressured to respond.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What policy should schools have about police questioning at school?</p>
			<p class="Body">If the school has a policy, it should cover:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>contacting parents or guardians when a student is under 17</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>contacting parents or guardians when a student is 17 or over</li>

				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>providing a school representative to observe an interview when the student is 17 or over.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">The policy should be written clearly, and should be supplied to all students, parents and caregivers.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4-first">What is bullying?</p>
			<p class="Body">Bullying is behaviour that makes you feel afraid or uncomfortable. It includes not just physical attacks but also verbal bullying and other emotional attacks, such as gossip, name-calling, humiliating or shaming people, and excluding people from groups and games.</p>
			<p class="Body">There are a range of legal and other protections against bullying, and these apply not just to things that students do but also to teachers’ behaviour</p>
			<p class="Body">With the arrival of texting and social networking websites, bullying in schools has become more sophisticated and more difficult to control – for example, bullies can create false online profiles or post abusive comments or embarrassing pictures or videos. Although “cyberbullying” of this type might start outside school, the flow-on effects can lead to serious problems within the school.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Schools’ responsibilities to protect against bullying</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">What are the school’s obligations to protect against bullying?</p>

A school that allows bullying to occur – for example by teachers failing to take action against it – could face prosecution under the health and safety laws. These health and safety requirements apply not just to school boards of trustees but also to governing committees of school boarding hostels.</li>

This means that they have to ensure the safety and well-being of students. A student who suffers harm through being bullied may be able to bring a claim in the courts for a breach of this duty of care. However, in particular cases this right may be barred by the ACC laws. Physical injuries, and psychological harm related to physical injuries, are likely to be covered by ACC, and that means you can’t bring civil claims in the courts for them.

			<p class="Heading-4-first">Reporting the bullying to the school</p>
			<p class="Body">If you are concerned that you or your child is being bullied at school, you should start by talking to the student’s teacher or the principal.</p>
			<p class="Body">Find out if the school has a specific anti-bullying policy, and processes for dealing with it. This policy may say who reports of bullying should be made to. You could also ask if the school has a “confidential disclosure system” so that both victims and bullies can talk safely about the bullying.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the school doesn’t have a specific anti-bullying policy you could emphasise to the school that it has a legal duty to provide a safe environment for students, and encourage them to develop a policy.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the school does have an anti-bullying policy but it doesn’t seem to be working in practice, you could ask that you meet with the principal and the chairperson of the board of trustees to discuss how to address this.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">How the school should respond</p>
			<p class="Body">The Children’s Commissioner has made suggestions about how schools should respond to reports of bullying. In summary, students and their parents should expect that the school will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>hear and respond to them with sensitivity</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>respond appropriately to the problem</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="Heading-4">What if we’re not happy with the school’s response?</p>
			<p class="Body">If a student and their parents aren’t happy about the way the school has dealt with a complaint of bullying, they can make a written complaint to the board of trustees. Parents can ask to be at the meeting where their complaint will be discussed. To get to speak at the meeting, parents will need permission from the chairperson. It may help to take along a support person who’s used to dealing with these sorts of complaints (see the support agencies listed at the end of this chapter.)</p>
			<p class="Body">If parents are unhappy with the way the board of trustees deals with their complaint, they can complain to the Education Review Office, the Ministry of Education or the Children’s Commissioner (see Useful Contacts).</p>

Young people aged 14, 15 or 16 can be charged and dealt with in the Youth Court, while those who have turned 17 could face a criminal charge in the District Court (the adult courts). In deciding whether to take action on a complaint, the police will consider all the circumstances, including how serious the behaviour was.</p>

If you’ve been cyberbullied, you can complain to the bully’s mobile phone provider or the social networking site. A warning to the bully from the provider that they could be banned from using their phone or the site is likely to be a powerful deterrent to them.</p>

			<p class="Body">If the cyberbullying involves physical threats, and you’re concerned about your safety, contact the police.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’ve been cyberbullied, you should make sure you save all the bullying messages and pictures. Text messages can be saved on a mobile phone, and you can save screenshots of bullying on websites or online chats. These can be useful if you report the bullying to your school or the police.</p>

			<p class="Heading-2">Boarders and school hostels</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">How school hostels are regulated and managed</p>
			<p class="Body">Boarding hostels are generally run by independent governing boards, even if the hostel is attached to a state or integrated school. Hostels must be licensed under the Education (Hostels) Regulations 2005.</p>
			<p class="Body">These regulations set out:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>minimum requirements for hostel premises and facilities, and for hostels’ management practices</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>options for the Ministry of Education to intervene if a hostel doesn’t meet the minimum requirements.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">A boarder or a boarder’s parent can complain to the owner of a hostel about a breach of these regulations: see below.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Do hostels have to have written policies and rules?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education (Hostels) Regulations 2005, regs 54, 57</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>Y</span>es. In managing the hostel the owners have to follow written policies and operating procedures.</p>
			<p class="Body">The hostel’s policies must ensure that its boarders:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>are supported in a positive learning environment</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>are given the opportunity to develop positively within reasonable boundaries</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>feel secure and valued</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>have ready access to people they can trust and confide in, and are supported in raising issues that concern them</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>have ready access to, and some choice about, health and other personal services they may need.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">Copies of the policies must be given to parents and boarders who ask for them. The hostel must review their policies at least every three years, and must consult with boarders and parents when they do these reviews.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What’s the legal relationship between the hostel and the student/parents?</p>
			<p class="Body">The relationship between parents, students and the hostel board is a contractual one, like a commercial agreement. Each party agrees to carry out their part:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>The parents agree to pay fees to the hostel.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>The hostel agrees to provide food, support and a safe environment for the student.</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>The student agrees to follow the hostel rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">A student’s relationship with the hostel is separate from their relationship with the school, as the hostel and the school are different institutions. So if the hostel cancels a student’s boarding contract, this doesn’t mean the student is suspended or expelled from the school itself.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Policy on hostel relationships and treatment of boarders</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education (Hostels) Regulations 2005, reg 55</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>A</span>ll hostels must have a policy that deals with relationships at the hostel, including relationships between the boarders and relationships between boarders and staff. This policy must help to make sure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>that boarders are treated with respect and dignity</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>that they’re given positive guidance promoting appropriate behaviour, and in a way that takes into account each boarder’s age and level of maturity</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>that they’re given positive guidance by the use of praise and encouragement, and that blame, harsh language, and belittling and degrading responses are avoided</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>that when boarders are being given direction and guidance they’re not discriminated against in any way (including by favouritism or hostility), they’re not physically ill-treated or put in solitary confinement, and they’re not refused food, drink, warmth, shelter, privacy or protection</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>that boarders are physically restrained only in the types of situations specified in the policy and only in accordance with the restrictions in the policy.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Heading-4">When can boarders have contact with their parents?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education (Hostels) Regulations 2005, reg 66</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>P</span>arents must be able to see or have contact with their child whenever the child is at the hostel and there’s no good reason for the hostel to deny this. A good reason for denying access or contact would include, for example, if a court order forbids it, or if a parent’s behaviour would be likely to be disruptive.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4"><a id="Anchor-172" />Wha<a id="Anchor-139" />t happens if a boarder breaches a hostel rule?</p>
			<p class="Body">The law doesn’t set out specific disciplinary processes for boarding hostels. Each hostel will instead have its own disciplinary policies and processes.</p>
			<p class="Body">The hostel has a contractual obligation to follow the policies and processes it has adopted, as part of the hostel’s contractual relationship with the boarder and parents. However, parents and students can also rely on an implied term of their contract that the hostel will behave fairly and reasonably.</p>
			<p class="Body">The hostel should have provided the student and parents with a list of hostel rules. If for example the student drank alcohol at the hostel, and this is specifically forbidden by the rules, the hostel should:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>interview each student involved in the incident and ask them for a response</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>consider each student’s response without prejudging whether or not they’re guilty</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>reach a decision based on the facts and evidence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">If the hostel rules clearly state that drinking alcohol can result in the student being expelled from the hostel, and the student is given a fair hearing, the board may be justified in cancelling their contract with the student and expelling them from the hostel.</p>
			<p class="Body">The hostel’s disciplinary policy may include an appeal procedure that you can use if you’re not happy with a disciplinary decision.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can a student be disciplined by the school for breaking hostel rules?</p>
			<p class="Body">The hostel and the school are separate institutions, and each will have to follow a proper process for dealing with misbehaviour according to their own rules. A student can’t be automatically expelled from school simply because they’ve been expelled from the hostel. Unfortunately, being expelled from the hostel often means the student won’t have a suitable place to live and so won’t be able to continue at <span>the school</span>.</p>
			<p class="Body">If a boarder has breached the hostel rules, the school principal will need to consider whether any school rule has also been breached. For example, if the boarder drank alcohol in the hostel and the school rules ban alcohol from the school premises, the principal will need to consider whether the hostel is part of the school premises. If the principal decides a school rule has in fact been broken, they’ll need to decide what action to take. If they formally suspend the student, the student will need to appear before a disciplinary hearing with the school board of trustees.</p>

			<p class="Body">All hostels must have a complaints process in place that is fair, simple, speedy and efficient.</p>

If you’re a student, you’re entitled to access to your school records and other information that the school holds about you, unless the school has a right to withhold the information on one of the specific grounds in the Privacy Act or some other Act. The grounds on which schools can withhold information include, among others:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>if you’re under 16 and the school thinks it wouldn’t be in your interests to give you the information</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>if the information was supplied by some other person and the school promised them that the information or that person’s identity, or both, would be kept confidential.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">If the school refuses to give you the information, they have to tell you why.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools are allowed to give you a summary of the information. If there is a reason for withholding some of a document, the school can also provide you with some of the document only, after deleting the other parts.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you think the school has withheld information from you wrongly, you should complain to the school first. If you’re not happy with the school’s response, you can then complain to the Privacy Commissioner.</p>

			<div class="xref-box frame-5">

The school doesn’t have to make the change if it disagrees that the information is wrong, but you can require the school to attach your statement to your file, so that both the school’s information and your statement will always be read together.</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools have to take all reasonable steps to make sure all the information they hold about you is accurate, up-to-date, complete, relevant and not misleading.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3"><a id="Anchor-175" />Par<a id="Anchor-141" />ents getting information from the school</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">How do parents and others go about getting information <span>from the school?</span></p>
			<p class="Body">If you want information about your child from their school, or if you’re a non-parent wanting information about a school (such as its policies), you should ask for this under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA). (Only the students themselves have a right to their school records under the Privacy Act.)</p>
			<p class="Body">Under the Official Information Act, the starting position is that the school has to make the information available. However, schools can withhold information if there are good reasons for doing so – for example, to protect the privacy of a student who has said things in confidence to a school counsellor, or if giving information to parents could have a serious effect on a student. Schools should get a student’s consent before giving out information about the student to their parents.</p>
			<p class="Body">When people other than parents ask for information, the school will also need to consider whether there’s a strong public interest in making the information available, one that outweighs the student’s interests. For example, if a reporter asks a school to explain a particular incident by providing information about particular students, the school would need to take care around giving out this information.</p>
			<p class="Body">If a school refuses to give out information after an OIA request, the person who asked for the information can take the matter to the Ombudsmen.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">When should parents be told about problems with a student?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-16">

			<p class="Body"><span>T</span>he principal has to take all reasonable steps to tell a student’s parents if there are problems that are preventing or slowing a student’s progress through school, or that are harming the student’s relationships with teachers or other students.

			<div class="xref-box frame-14">
				<p class="Note" xml:lang="en-GB">Note: Schools, including boards of trustees, are bound by the rules in the Privacy Act 1993 for dealing with information.

For students enrolled in years 1–8, schools must also provide a written report on the student’s progress and achievement in relation to the National Standards, at least twice a year.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Who does the school have to give school reports to?</p>
			<p class="Body">Schools can provide reports to both parents, but usually they only provide them to the main caregiver.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">

			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>f a student asks the school not to give out information about them to one of their parents, the school will need to consider the obligation to inform parents of anything the principal thinks is preventing or slowing the student’s progress through the school or harming the student’s relationships with teachers or other students.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can one parent stop the school giving information to the other parent?</p>
			<p class="Body">No, not unless they have a court order.</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-16">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Education Act 1989, s 77(b), and ss 60, 92 (“parent” definition)</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>f the principal believes there are problems that are slowing a student’s progress or harming their relationships at school, they must take reasonable steps to inform the student’s parents. It makes no difference if the parents are separated. Both parents are entitled to the same information about their child, unless it isn’t reasonable to expect the school to provide the information to both – for example, if one of the parents lives overseas and can’t be contacted. “Parent” here also includes guardians and immediate caregivers.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Can a student stop the school passing their records on to <span>a particular parent</span>?</p>
			<p class="Body">A student can ask the school, but schools don’t always have to agree to this. There may be a written parenting agreement or a court order that deals with this, in which case the school would need to comply with the agreement or order. In other cases the school’s response would depend on the particular circumstances – including whether the parent is a legal guardian of the student, the student’s age and level of maturity, whether there’s a public interest in releasing the information, and the obligation to keep parents informed about any problems at school.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Do I have the right to see health information that the school holds about my child?</p>
			<div class="xref-box frame-5">
				<p class="legislation" xml:lang="en-GB">Health Act 1956, s 22F; Health Information Privacy Code 1994, rule 11</p>
			</div>
			<p class="Body"><span>I</span>t depends. If the school is providing health services (for example, through a school nurse), parents generally have rights to their child’s health information, if the child is under 16.</p>
			<p class="Body">Occasionally, if the school is satisfied that giving out the information isn’t in the student’s interest and is more likely to harm the student, the school doesn’t have to release the information – for example, if giving it out might be a breach of trust and could mean the student won’t be willing to access confidential counselling, sexual health services, or other health facilities. If your request for information is denied, you can complain to the Privacy Commissioner.</p>
			<p class="Body">It’s best if schools encourage students to share the information themselves with their caregivers wherever possible.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">Do I have the right to see information about my child held by the school counsellor?</p>
			<p class="Body">No. School counsellors have no legal obligation to inform parents that a student is receiving counselling and no obligation to pass on anything the student tells the counsellor.</p>
			<p class="Body">School counsellors have to comply with the Privacy Act and if they belong to the New Zealand Association of Counsellors, they also have to comply with the association’s Code of Professional Ethics. The Code makes it clear that all communication between a counsellor and client must be kept confidential, unless the counsellor believes there’s a clear and imminent danger to the client or someone else. Only in limited circumstances can school counsellors notify the police or Child, Youth and Family – for example, if a student is under 17 and the counsellor believes the student has been abused or is at risk of abuse.</p>

			<p class="Heading-4-first">What should I do if I have a complaint about privacy?</p>
			<p class="Body">If you have a concern about a privacy issue, you should contact the school first and speak with the school’s privacy officer. You should tell the school what you would like done to help put the matter right – for example, you might want an apology, or to have inaccurate information corrected.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’re not satisfied with the school’s response you can then complain to the Privacy Commissioner, who can decide to investigate. This service is free, but may take several months.</p>

			<p class="Body">It’s usually a good idea to try to resolve your problem within the school first, as there’s likely to be an ongoing relationship between you, your child and the staff.</p>
			<p class="Body">It can be helpful to discuss your issue with someone else – a friend, family, or someone from the Student Rights Service (0800 499 488).</p>
			<p class="Body">If you’re unhappy with the school’s response, you may want to take your complaint to an outside organisation – <a href="#Anchor-157"><span class="xref">see </span><span class="xref">page </span><span class="xref">132</span></a>.</p>
			<p class="Heading-2">How to resolve disputes at school</p>
			<p class="Body">Dispute resolution is when two parties try to resolve an issue between them. For example, when a parent wants to talk to a teacher about classroom bullying, or when a principal organizes a meeting with a student about a stand-down.</p>
			<p class="Body">There are many ways to approach these kinds of disputes. This section will give some tips for getting the best result at school.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Get to the heart of the issue</p>
			<p class="Heading-4-first">What’s important to you?</p>
			<p class="Body">Before meeting with the other person, you should try to think about what is really important to you. Is it staying in school? Feeling safe? Getting more help?</p>
			<p class="Body">For example, you might feel very angry at a teacher and want to make a formal complaint. However, try to get to the heart of the issue. Why are you angry? Are you feeling bullied by the teacher? Do you not feel heard? Sometimes making a complaint is not the best way to resolve these kinds of issues. Perhaps you could speak to the teacher and explain how you or your child is feeling. Try to think about what is best for the student-teacher relationship.</p>
			<p class="Heading-4">What’s important to the other side?</p>
			<p class="Body">Also, try to think about what is important to the other side. You might even want to ask them why they are taking a position. For example, if the principal wants to punish your child for bullying, you could ask them: “What’s your basic concern in wanting to stand my child down?” Perhaps the principal is mainly concerned about keeping other kids safe. You might be able to think of ways to ease this fear. For example, if your child is willing to go to anger management counseling, the principal might not think a stand-down is necessary.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Foster relationships</p>
			<p class="Body">Remember that there is an ongoing relationship between parents, students and the school. The way that problems are dealt with can have an effect on these relationships going forward, and might have consequences for the way problems are treated in the future. It’s best if you can deal with issues in a way that helps, rather than hinders, these relationships.</p>
			<p class="Body">When meeting with a teacher or principal, it’s a good idea to build a good relationship as soon as possible. For example, you could call them before the meeting and ask if there’s anything you can bring or do to help the meeting to run smoothly.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Don’t blame</p>
			<p class="Body">When talking about a problem, try to separate the symptoms from the person you’re talking with. Try not to blame the other side for the problem. This can be very difficult. But even if blame is justified, it’s usually not very productive in getting to a solution. Try to stay focused on the result you want.</p>

			<p class="Heading-3">Acknowledge emotions</p>
			<p class="Body">With school issues, you’re likely to be dealing with difficult and frustrating situations, where emotions are running high on all sides.</p>
			<p class="Body">If you become emotional in a meeting, it can help to ask to take a break. You can call someone, go for a quick walk, or sit outside until you feel better. For this reason, it can be very helpful to have a support person with you, who can remain calm and take control if you need them to.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the other side is becoming emotional or frustrated, you could also suggest a break. Even though it’s hard, it is also helpful to try to listen quietly while they describe their grievances. It helps to keep frustration from building, and hopefully they’ll do the same for you.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Educate</p>
			<p class="Body">If the principal, teacher or board has the wrong idea about something, you can look for ways to educate them. Their fears, even if mistaken, are real and can influence their decision. It’s good if you can get them on the right track.</p>
			<p class="Body">For example, if your child has ADHD, the board might be worried about the effects. It could be useful to bring information from your doctor, so that they have accurate information.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3">Make decisions easy</p>
			<p class="Body">After you’ve tried to get to the heart of what the other side wants, it’s very helpful to make your suggestions consistent with their values. They might be worried about being inconsistent with past actions, so it’s a good idea to show them that the decision is good for them.</p>
			<p class="Body">For example, a school might be known for its zero-tolerance policy on bullying. It also has a duty to keep other students safe. In a meeting, recognize this and make suggestions that will ensure other students’ safety while keeping your child in school.</p>
			<p class="Heading-2"><a id="Anchor-157" />Making a complaint to an outside organisation</p>
			<p class="Body">Note that many of these organisations will only look at complaints if you have tried to resolve the issue through the school but are unhappy with the outcome. If you haven’t talked to your school first, they’re likely to send it back to you (unless you’ve got a good reason why you can’t talk to the school, like a safety concern).</p>
			<p class="Body">Many will also not respond to anonymous complaints.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3 para-style-override-12">Office of the Ombudsmen&#9;</p>
			<p class="Body">Complaints about decisions by boards of trustees and official information complaints</p>
			<p class="Body">The Ombudsman can investigate complaints about decisions made by your board of trustees. If the Ombudsman decides the board acted unfairly, it can make a recommendation to the school. The Ombudsman can’t make the school accept its recommendation, but most are accepted.</p>
			<p class="Body">This is also who you can complain to if a school denies your request for official information.</p>
			<p class="Heading-3 para-style-override-12">Education Review Office (ERO)</p>
			<p class="Body">Complaints about the running of the school</p>
			<p class="Body">ERO reviews the running of each school about once every three years. Generally, ERO doesn’t deal with individual complaints. However, if several parents make similar complaints, ERO will make a note and look at the issue when they next visit. In extreme cases, they can bring the next review forward or organise a special review.</p>
			<p class="Body">All complaints are noted, and could affect the school’s ERO report, which is a public record.</p>

			<p class="Body">Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
			<p class="Body">On [<span class="itals">date</span>] we attended a board of trustees’ disciplinary hearing with our [<span class="itals">son/daughter, their name</span>]. We do not consider the hearing was conducted in a fair manner for the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>[<span class="itals">state reasons</span>]</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">Because we consider the meeting to have been procedurally unfair, we realise we could ask the Ombudsman to consider our case.</p>
			<p class="Body">However we believe, if possible, the school should be given a chance to remedy the situation. Consequently, we would ask that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>the suspension be lifted and [<span class="itals">name</span>] be reinstated at [<span class="itals">name of school</span>]; or</li>
				<li class="Bullet"><span class="char-style-override-3">&#9;</span>the board convene another hearing so that these concerns can be fully discussed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Body">We realise the board is under no legal obligation to review the decision, but when considering all options this would seem the most advantageous for all concerned.</p>
			<p class="Body">We would be grateful if you could convey your decision to us within the next five days.</p>
